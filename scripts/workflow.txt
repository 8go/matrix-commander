The rough workflow is:
======================

git pull # get the latest from Github
write some code
run test scripts in tests/test*sh and tests/test*py

scripts/lintmc.sh
scripts/update-1-version.sh
scripts/update-2-help.py
scripts/update-3-readme.py
# produce PyPi distribution
# maybe cancel upload to PyPi if Github Actions workflow is preferred
scripts/create-pypi-package.sh

git status
# don't forget to add the new PyPi dist/* files
git add dist/
git status

git commit
scripts/update-4-tag-between-commit-and-push.sh
git push
# that kicks off the Docker actions workflow on Github
# that kicks off the PiPy actions workflow on Github

# double-check if everything is in order
git tag # list tags
git log --pretty=oneline # now it shows tag in commit hash

# watch Actions on Github
