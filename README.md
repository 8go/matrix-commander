# Summary, TLDR

This simple Matrix client written in Python allows you to send and
receive messages and files, verify other devices, and interact with
your Matrix account or other Matrix users in many ways.
You use it from the terminal (CLI) or integrate it into other simple
Python programs. Enjoy and please :star: star on Github.

# matrix-commander

Simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending, receiving,
creating rooms, inviting, verifying, and so much more.

- `matrix-commander` is a simple command-line [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
  client.
- It is a simple but convenient app to
    - send Matrix text messages as well as text, image, audio, video or
      other arbitrary files
    - listen to and receive Matrix messages, images, audio, video, etc.
    - download media files like images or audio
    - perform Matrix emoji verification
    - performs actions of rooms (create rooms, invite to rooms, etc.)
    - list rooms and room members
    - and much more
- It exclusively offers a command-line interface (CLI).
- Hence the word-play: matrix-command(lin)er
- There is no GUI and there are no windows (except for pop-up windows in
  OS notification)
- It uses the [matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/) SDK
- Both `matrix-nio` and `matrix-commander` are written in Python 3
- Convenient to install via `pip`.

# What for? Why? For whom? Use cases?

Use cases for this program could be
- a bot or part of a bot,
- to automate sending via programs and scripts
- `matrix-nio show case`: as educational material that showcases the use
  of the `matrix-nio` SDK
- `alerter`: to send all sorts of alerts,
- `Gitlab CI automation tool`: some user uses it as Gitlab CI automation tool
   to report build success/failure to their internal Matrix room.
   See [Issue #81](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/issues/81).
- `admin tool` or `automation tool`: you needs to create 175 room for the
   roll-out within a company? You want to query some 9000 rooms for
   visibility data? You want to collect profile data of 7000 enterprise or
   public users? `matrix-commander` has many admin capabilities and can
   automate many tasks completely. Many admin jobs can be reduced to running
   a simple bash script or a simple Python program using `matrix-commander`.
- `reminder`: send yourself or others daily/weekly reminders via a cron job.
- `surf report`: an addict surfer uses `matrix-commander` combined with a
   `cron` job to publish daily early morning surf reports for his 3 favorite
   surfing spots to his Element app.
- `juke box`: a user told me he has a large collection of mp3 files on his
  server. He uses `matrix-commander` to send himself a random song from
  his music collection to brighten his day.
- `ticker`: many people send themselves stock prices from one of the many
  public ticker APIs. This is usually a single `curl` command piped into
  `matrix-commander`.
- `poor-man's Matrix client`: if you love the terminal and are too lazy to
   start up an Element desktop app or an Element webpage,
   `matrix-commander` is a a trivial way to fire off some instant
   messages to your friends from the terminal.
- `poor-man's importer or exporter`: you want to get things in and out of
   Matrix?
   Send those 39 holiday picture you have laying around in a holiday folder?
   Or, your best friend just sent you 57 wedding pictures on Element and
   you want to store them? `matrix-commander` can help with importing and
   exporting data.
- `poor man's blogger`: a "blogger" who frequently sends messages and
  images to the same public room(s) could use `matrix-commander` to keep
  his audience informed.
- `poor man's diary`: a person could write a diary or run a gratitude
  journal by sending messages to her/his own diary room or gratitude room.
- `ghost`: `matrix-commander` can be used in an ephemeral fashion, in a
  fire-and-forget style. A single batch command can log in, create a
  new device, send a message, and then log out and delete the device.

# First Run, Set Up, Credentials File, End-to-end Encryption

On the first run `matrix-commander` must be executed with the
`--login` argument and the corresponding secondary arguments.
This creates a credentials.json file.
The credentials.json file stores: homeserver, user id,
access token, device id, and default room id. On the first run,
the --login run, it asks some questions if not everything is
provided by arguments, creates the token and device id
and stores everything in the credentials.json file. If desired,
all arguments can be provided via arguments to that log in can
be performed fully in batch.

Since the credentials file holds an access token it
should be protected and secured. One can use different
credential files for different users (or different default rooms).

On creation the credentials file will by default be created in the local
directory, so the users sees it right away. This is fine if you have
only one or a few credential files, but for better maintainability
it is suggested to place your credentials files into directory
`$HOME/.config/matrix-commander/`. When the program looks for
a credentials file it will first look in local directory and then
as secondary choice it will look in directory
`$HOME/.config/matrix-commander/`.

If you want to re-use an existing device id and an existing
access token, you can do so as well, just manually edit the
credentials file. However, for end-to-end encryption this will
NOT work.

End-to-end encryption (e2ee) is enabled by default. It cannot be turned off.
Wherever possible end-to-end encryption will be used. For e2ee to work
efficiently a `store` directory is needed to store e2ee data persistently.
The default location for the store directory is a local directory named
`store`. Alternatively, as a secondary choice the program looks for a store
directory in `$HOME/.local/share/matrix-commander/store/`. The user can always
specify a different location via the --store argument. The `store`
directory will usually be created on the first run.

For specific use cases end-to-end encryption can be disabled. Please see
description of flag `--plain` for details.

From the second time the program is run, and on all
future runs it will use the homeserver, user id
and access token found in the credentials file to log
into the Matrix account. Now this program can be used
to easily send simple text messages, images, and so forth
to the just configured room.

# Verification

As second step after the `--login`, it is recommended to perform an
emoji verification by running `--verify`. Verification is always
interactive, because the emojis need to be confirmed via the keyboard.
If desired `--login` and `--verify` can be done in the same first run.
The program can accept verification request and verify other devices
via emojis. See `--verify` in help for more details.

# Room Operations, Actions on Rooms

The program can create rooms, join, leave and forget rooms.
It can also send invitations to join rooms to
others (given that user has the appropriate permissions) as
well as ban, unban and kick other users from rooms.

# Sending

Messages to send can be provided
1) in the command line (-m or --message)
2) as input from the keyboard (if there is no other input or command)
3) through a pipe from stdin (|), i.e. piped in from another program.

For sending messages the program supports various text formats:
1) text: default
2) html:  HTML formatted text
3) markdown: MarkDown formatted text
4) code: used a block of fixed-sized font, ideal for ASCII art or
   tables, bash outputs, etc.
5) notification
6) split: splits messages into multiple units at given pattern

Photos and images that can be sent. That includes files like
`.jpg`, `.gif`, `.png` or `.svg`.

Arbitrary files like `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.doc`, audio files like `.mp3`
or video files like `.mp4` can also be sent.

Matrix events like sending an emoji reaction, replying as a thread,
message edits can be sent.

# Listening, Receiving

One can listen to one or multiple rooms. Received messages will be displayed
on the screen. If desired, optionally, you can be notified of incoming
messages through the operating system standard notification system, usually a
small pop-up window.

Messages can be received or listened to various ways:
1) Forever: the program runs forever, listens forever, and prints all
   messages as they arrive in real-time.
2) Once: the program prints all the messages that are waiting in the queue,
   i.e. all messages that have been sent in, and after printing them the
   program terminates.
3) Tail: prints the last N read or unread messages of one or multiple
   specified rooms and after printing them the program terminates.

When listening to messages you can also choose to download and decrypt
media. Say, someone is sending a song. The mp3 file can be downloaded
and automatically decrypted for you.

# Dependencies and Installation

- If you install via `pip`, then `pip` will take care of most of the
  dependencies.
  - See https://pypi.org/project/matrix-commander
  - Usually `pip install matrix-commander` will do the trick.
  - But, note that even if you install via `pip` you must have a) Python 3.8+
    and b) `libolm` installed. See `PyPi-Instructions.md`.
  - Run `python -V` to get your Python version number and assure that it is
    3.8+.
  - For e2ee support, python-olm is needed which requires the libolm C
    library (version 3.x). See also https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm.
    Make sure that version 3 is installed. Version 2 will not work.
    To install `libolm` do this:
    - On Debian, Ubuntu and Debian/Ubuntu derivative distributions:
      `sudo apt install libolm-dev`
    - On Fedora or Fedora derivative distributions do:
      `sudo dnf install libolm-devel`
    - On MacOS use brew:
      `brew install libolm`

- For macOS Monterey 12.4 (21F79) (Apple M1 Pro) and similar please follow
  these steps for installation:

  - Install `libolm`, `dbus` and `libmagic` using Homebrew:
      - `brew install libolm dbus libmagic`
  - Install `matrix-commander` using this command:
      - `pip3 install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/opt/homebrew/include/" --global-option="-L/opt/homebrew/lib/" matrix-commander`
  - For more details see Issue #79. Thanks to @KizzyCode for the contribution.

- For macOS x86_64 and similar please follow these steps for installation:

  - `brew install libolm dbus libmagic`
  - `pip3 install poetry`
  - `pip3 install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/include/" --global-option="-L/usr/local/lib/"  matrix-commander`
  - Notice that the Link and Include directories between ARM (M1, etc.)
    and x86-64 are different.
    So, check for example where file `olm.h` is located on your hard disk.
    That gives you a hint which Include directory to use.
  - For more details see Issue #103. Thanks to @johannes87 for the contribution.

- If you install a docker image: `matrix-commander` is available on
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixcommander/matrix-commander)
  and hence easy to install as docker image (:clap: to @pataquets for his PR).
  Install via `docker pull matrixcommander/matrix-commander`.

- If you install it via `git` or via file download then these are the
  dependencies that you must take care of:

    - Python 3.8 or higher installed (3.7 will NOT work)
    - libolm-dev must be installed as it is required by matrix-nio
      - libolm-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, libolm-devel on Fedora, libolm on MacOS
    - matrix-nio must be installed, see https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade matrix-nio[e2e]
    - python3 package markdown must be installed to support MarkDown format
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade markdown
    - python3 package emoji must be installed to support emojis in text messages
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade emoji
    - python3 package python_magic must be installed to support image sending
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade python_magic
    - if (and only if) you want OS notification support, then the python3
      package notify2 and dbus-python should be installed
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade dbus-python # optional
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade notify2 # optional
    - python3 package urllib must be installed to support media download
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade urllib
    - python3 package pyxdg must be installed to support `XDG_*` env vars.
      Be careful. Multiple packages install in the same directory `xdg` and
      overwrite each other. These packages can be conflicting. Specifically,
      packages `pyxdg` and `xdg` collide. If you already have `xdg` installed
      you cannot just simply install `pyxdg`; in this case you should opt
      for a separate Python environment.
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade pyxdg
    - `matrix_commander/matrix_commander.py` file must be installed, and should
      have execution permissions
      - chmod 755 matrix_commander.py
    - `matrix_commander/matrix-commander` file is recommended for the install,
      and should have execution permissions
      - chmod 755 matrix-commander
    - for a full list or requirements look at the `requirements.txt` file
      - run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install
        all required Python packages
      - if you e.g. run on a headless server and don't want dbus-python and
        notify2, please remove the corresponding 2 lines from
        the `requirements.txt` file

- Installing dependencies of `matrix-commander-tui`
  - `matrix-commander-tui` requires that you install `vipe` from the package `moreutils`.
    - Read https://www.putorius.net/moreutils.html for installation instructions.
    - As an alternative you could also install `vipe.sh` from https://github.com/0mp/vipe.sh/blob/master/vipe.sh.
  - `matrix-commander-tui` requires that you install `fzf`.
    - Read https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation for installation instructions.

# Examples of calling `matrix-commander`

- Alternative 1: Usually `matrix-commander` is called from a terminal
  inside a shell like `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, your Windows CMD terminal
  or similar. You will find plenty of examples how to use it within
  a terminal just a few lines down.
  Or invoke it via the TUI (Terminal User Interface) tool `matrix-commander-tui`.
- Alternative 2: Sometimes, however, it might be more convenient to call
  `matrix-commander` from within a Python program. This is also possible.
  Import the Python module `matrix_commander` and use the provided
  entry point `main`. An example of how this can be done can be found
  in [tests/test-send.py](
  https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/blob/master/tests/test-send.py).

```bash
$ matrix-commander --login password # first run; will configure everything
$ matrix-commander --login sso # alternative first run with Single Sign-On;
$ # this will configure everything on a headless server w/o a browser
$ # this created a credentials.json file, and a store directory.
$ # optionally, if you want you can move credentials to app config directory
$ mkdir $HOME/.config/matrix-commander # optional
$ mv -i credentials.json $HOME/.config/matrix-commander/
$ # optionally, if you want you can move store to the app share directory
$ mkdir $HOME/.local/share/matrix-commander # optional
$ mv -i store $HOME/.local/share/matrix-commander/
$ # Now you are ready to run program for a second time
$ # Let us verify the device/room to where we want to send messages
$ # The other device will issue a "verify by emoji" request
$ matrix-commander --verify
$ # Now program is both configured and verified, let us send the first message
$ matrix-commander -m "First message!"
$ matrix-commander --debug -m "First message!" # turn debugging on
$ # turn debugging on also for submodules
$ matrix-commander --debug --debug -m "First message!"
$ # turn debugging on, high verbosity
$ matrix-commander --debug --verbose -m "First message!"
$ # turn debugging on, very high verbosity
$ matrix-commander --debug --verbose --verbose -m "First message!"
$ # maximum debugging info
$ matrix-commander --debug --debug --verbose --verbose -m "First message!"
$ matrix-commander --help # print help
$ matrix-commander # this will ask user for message to send
$ matrix-commander --message "Hello World!" # sends provided message
$ echo "Hello World" | matrix-commander # pipe input msg into program

# Usage
```
Welcome to matrix-commander, a Matrix CLI client. ─── On first run use --login
to log in, to authenticate. On second run we suggest to use --verify to get
verified. Emoji verification is built-in which can be used to verify devices. On
further runs this program implements a simple Matrix CLI client that can send
messages, listen to messages, verify devices, etc. It can send one or multiple
message to one or multiple Matrix rooms and/or users. The text messages can be
of various formats such as "text", "html", "markdown" or "code". Images, audio,
arbitrary files, or events can be sent as well. For receiving there are three
main options: listen forever, listen once and quit, and get the last N messages
and quit. End-to-end encryption is enabled by default and cannot be turned off,
but it can be disabled for specific use cases.  ─── Bundling several actions
together into a single call to matrix-commander is faster than calling matrix-
commander multiple times with only one action. If there are both 'set' and 'get'
actions present in the arguments, then the 'set' actions will be performed
before the 'get' actions. Then send actions and at the very end listen actions
will be performed. ─── For even more explications and examples also read the
documentation provided in the on-line Github README.md file or the README.md in
your local installation.  ─── For less information just use --help instead of
--manual.

Welcome to matrix-commander, a Matrix CLI client.

options:
  --usage               Print usage. Details:: See also --help for printing a
                        bit more and --manual for printing a lot more detailed
                        information.
  -h, --help            Print help. Details:: See also --usage for printing
                        even less information, and --manual for printing more
                        detailed information.
  --manual              Print manual. Details:: See also --usage for printing
                        the absolute minimum, and --help for printing less.
  --readme              Print README.md file. Details:: Tries to print the
                        local README.md file from installation. If not found
                        it will get the README.md file from github.com and
                        print it. See also --usage, --help, and --manual.
  -d, --debug           Print debug information. Details:: If used once, only
                        the log level of matrix-commander is set to DEBUG. If
                        used twice ("-d -d" or "-dd") then log levels of both
                        matrix-commander and underlying modules are set to
                        DEBUG. "-d" is a shortcut for "--log-level DEBUG". See
                        also --log-level. "-d" takes precedence over "--log-
                        level". Additionally, have a look also at the option "
                        --verbose".
  --log-level DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL [DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL ...]
                        Set the log level(s). Details:: Possible values are
                        "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", and "CRITICAL".
                        If --log_level is used with one level argument, only
                        the log level of matrix-commander is set to the
                        specified value. If --log_level is used with two level
                        argument (e.g. "--log-level WARNING ERROR") then log
                        levels of both matrix-commander and underlying modules
                        are set to the specified values. See also --debug.
  --verbose             Set the verbosity level. Details:: If not used, then
                        verbosity will be set to low. If used once, verbosity
                        will be high. If used more than once, verbosity will
                        be very high. Verbosity only affects the debug
                        information. So, if '--debug' is not used then '--
                        verbose' will be ignored.
  --login PASSWORD|SSO  Login to and authenticate with the Matrix homeserver.
                        Details:: This requires exactly one argument, the
                        login method. Currently two choices are offered:
                        'password' and 'sso'. Provide one of these methods. If
                        you have chosen 'password', you will authenticate
                        through your account password. You can optionally
                        provide these additional arguments: --homeserver to
                        specify the Matrix homeserver, --user-login to specify
                        the log in user id, --password to specify the
                        password, --device to specify a device name, --room-
                        default to specify a default room for
                        sending/listening. If you have chosen 'sso', you will
                        authenticate through Single Sign-On. A web-browser
                        will be started and you authenticate on the webpage.
                        You can optionally provide these additional arguments:
                        --homeserver to specify the Matrix homeserver, --user-
                        login to specify the log in user id, --device to
                        specify a device name, --room-default to specify a
                        default room for sending/listening. See all the extra
                        arguments for further explanations. ----- SSO (Single
                        Sign-On) starts a web browser and connects the user to
                        a web page on the server for login. SSO will only work
                        if the server supports it and if there is access to a
                        browser. So, don't use SSO on headless homeservers
                        where there is no browser installed or accessible.
  --verify [EMOJI]      Perform verification. Details:: By default, no
                        verification is performed. Possible values are:
                        "emoji". If verification is desired, run this program
                        in the foreground (not as a service) and without a
                        pipe. While verification is optional it is highly
                        recommended, and it is recommended to be done right
                        after (or together with) the --login action.
                        Verification is always interactive, i.e. it required
                        keyboard input. Verification questions will be printed
                        on stdout and the user has to respond via the keyboard
                        to accept or reject verification. Once verification is
                        complete, the program may be run as a service.
                        Verification is best done as follows: Perform a cross-
                        device verification, that means, perform a
                        verification between two devices of the *same* user.
                        For that, open (e.g.) Element in a browser, make sure
                        Element is using the same user account as the matrix-
                        commander user (specified with --user-login at
                        --login). Now in the Element webpage go to the room
                        that is the matrix-commander default room (specified
                        with --room-default at --login). OK, in the web-
                        browser you are now the same user and in the same room
                        as matrix-commander. Now click the round 'i' 'Room
                        Info' icon, then click 'People', click the appropriate
                        user (the matrix-commander user), click red 'Not
                        Trusted' text which indicated an untrusted device,
                        then click the square 'Interactively verify by Emoji'
                        button (one of 3 button choices). At this point both
                        web-page and matrix-commander in terminal show a set
                        of emoji icons and names. Compare them visually.
                        Confirm on both sides (Yes, They Match, Got it),
                        finally click OK. You should see a green shield and
                        also see that the matrix-commander device is now green
                        and verified in the webpage. In the terminal you
                        should see a text message indicating success. You
                        should now be verified across all devices and across
                        all users.
  --logout ME|ALL       Logout. Details:: Logout this or all devices from the
                        Matrix homeserver. This requires exactly one argument.
                        Two choices are offered: 'me' and 'all'. Provide one
                        of these choices. If you choose 'me', only the one
                        device matrix-commander is currently using will be
                        logged out. If you choose 'all', all devices of the
                        user used by matrix-commander will be logged out.
                        While --logout neither removes the credentials nor the
                        store, the logout action removes the device and makes
                        the access-token stored in the credentials invalid.
                        Hence, after a --logout, one must manually remove
                        credentials and store, and then perform a new --login
                        to use matrix-commander again. You can perfectly use
                        matrix-commander without ever logging out. --logout is
                        a cleanup if you have decided not to use this (or all)
                        device(s) ever again.
  -c CREDENTIALS_FILE, --credentials CREDENTIALS_FILE
                        Specify location of credentials file. Details:: On
                        first run, information about homeserver, user, room
                        id, etc. will be written to a credentials file. By
                        default, this file is "credentials.json". On further
                        runs the credentials file is read to permit logging
                        into the correct Matrix account and sending messages
                        to the preconfigured room. If this option is provided,
                        the provided file name will be used as credentials
                        file instead of the default one.
  -s STORE_DIRECTORY, --store STORE_DIRECTORY
                        Specify location of store directory. Details:: Path to
                        directory to be used as "store" for encrypted
                        messaging. By default, this directory is "./store/".
                        Since encryption is always enabled, a store is always
                        needed. The provided directory name will be used as
                        persistent storage directory instead of the default
                        one. Preferably, for multiple executions of this
                        program use the same store for the same device. The
                        store directory can be shared between multiple
                        different devices and users.
  -r ROOM [ROOM ...], --room ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Specify one or multiple rooms. Details:: Optionally
                        specify one or multiple rooms via room ids or room
                        aliases. --room is used by various send actions and
                        various listen actions. The default room is provided
                        in the credentials file (specified at --login with
                        --room-default). If a room (or multiple ones) is (or
                        are) provided in the --room arguments, then it (or
                        they) will be used instead of the one from the
                        credentials file. The user must have access to the
                        specified room in order to send messages there or
                        listen on the room. Messages cannot be sent to
                        arbitrary rooms. When specifying the room id some
                        shells require the exclamation mark to be escaped with
                        a backslash. As an alternative to specifying a room as
                        destination, one can specify a user as a destination
                        with the '--user' argument. See '--user' and the term
                        'DM (direct messaging)' for details. Specifying a room
                        is always faster and more efficient than specifying a
                        user. Not all listen operations allow setting a room.
                        Read more under the --listen options and similar. Most
                        actions also support room aliases instead of room ids.
                        Some even short room aliases.
  --room-default DEFAULT_ROOM
                        Specify the default room at --login. Details::
                        Optionally specify a room as the default room for
                        future actions. If not specified for --login, it will
                        be queried via the keyboard. --login stores the
                        specified room as default room in your credentials
                        file. This option is only used in combination with
                        --login. A default room is needed. Specify a valid
                        room either with --room-default or provide it via
                        keyboard.
  --room-create ROOM_ALIAS [ROOM_ALIAS ...]
                        Create one or multiple rooms for given alias(es).
                        Details:: One or multiple room aliases can be
                        specified. For each alias specified a room will be
                        created. For each created room one line with room id
                        and alias will be printed to stdout. If you are not
                        interested in an alias, provide an empty string like
                        "". The alias provided must be in canonical local
                        form, i.e. if you want a final full alias like
                        "#SomeRoomAlias:matrix.example.com" you must provide
                        the string 'SomeRoomAlias'. The user must be permitted
                        to create rooms. Combine --room-create with --name and
                        --topic to add names and topics to the room(s) to be
                        created. Rooms are by default created encrypted; to
                        overwrite that and to create a room with encryption
                        disabled use '--plain'. Room id, room alias,
                        encryption and other fields are printed as output, one
                        line per created room.
  --room-dm-create USER [USER ...]
                        Create one or multiple DM rooms with the specified
                        users. Details:: For each user specified a DM room
                        will be created and the user invited to it. For each
                        created room one line with room id and alias will be
                        printed to stdout. The user must be permitted to
                        create rooms. Combine --room-dm-create with --name,
                        --topic, --alias to add names, topics and aliases to
                        the room(s) to be created. DM rooms are by default
                        created encrypted; to overwrite that and to create a
                        room with encryption disabled use '--plain'. See
                        option '--room-dm-create-allow-duplicates'. If not
                        used, then an invitation-accepted DM room is searched.
                        If an existing DM room is found, no new DM room will
                        be created. If currently no invitation-accepted DM
                        room exists or --room-dm-create-allow-duplicates is
                        used, then a new DM will be created. Note, that one
                        can create/have any number of DM rooms with the same
                        person. Room id, room alias, encryption and other
                        fields are printed as output, one line per created
                        room. If a room is not created because one already
                        exists, then the room id of the first DM room found is
                        printed, but neither the alias nor other fields.
  --room-dm-create-allow-duplicates
                        Allow creating duplicate DM rooms. Details:: By
                        default, if this option is bot used duplicates are
                        avoided. Actions that support this option are: --room-
                        dm-create. To overwrite that default and to allow the
                        creation of a DM room even if a DM room already
                        exists, use '--room-dm-create-allow-duplicates'. See
                        the --room-dm-create commands.
  --room-join ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Join one room or multiple rooms. Details:: One or
                        multiple room aliases can be specified. The room (or
                        multiple ones) provided in the arguments will be
                        joined. The user must have permissions to join these
                        rooms.
  --room-leave ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Leave one room or multiple rooms. Details:: One or
                        multiple room aliases can be specified. The room (or
                        multiple ones) provided in the arguments will be left.
  --room-forget ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Forget one room or multiple rooms. Details:: After
                        leaving a room you should (most likely) forget the
                        room. Forgetting a room removes the users' room
                        history. One or multiple room aliases can be
                        specified. The room (or multiple ones) provided in the
                        arguments will be forgotten. If all users forget a
                        room, the room can eventually be deleted on the
                        server.
  --room-invite ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Invite one ore more users to join one or more rooms.
                        Details:: Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user.
                        Specify the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-invite. The user must have
                        permissions to invite users. Don't confuse this option
                        with --room-invites.
  --room-ban ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Ban one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Details:: Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user.
                        Specify the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-ban. The user must have
                        permissions to ban users.
  --room-unban ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Unban one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Details:: Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user.
                        Specify the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-unban. The user must have
                        permissions to unban users.
  --room-kick ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Kick one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Details:: Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user.
                        Specify the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-kick. The user must have
                        permissions to kick users.
  -u USER [USER ...], --user USER [USER ...]
                        Specify one or multiple users. Details:: This option
                        is meaningful in combination with a) room actions like
                        --room-invite, --room-ban, --room-unban, etc. and b)
                        send actions like -m, -i, -f, etc. c) some listen
                        actions --listen, as well as d) actions like --delete-
                        device. In case of a) this option --user specifies the
                        users to be used with room commands (like invite, ban,
                        etc.). In case of b) the option --user can be used as
                        an alternative to specifying a room as destination for
                        text (-m), images (-i), etc. For send actions '--user'
                        is providing the functionality of 'DM (direct
                        messaging)'. For c) this option allows an alternative
                        to specifying a room as destination for some --listen
                        actions. For d) this gives the option to delete the
                        device of a different user. ----- What is a DM?
                        matrix-commander tries to find a room that contains
                        only the sender and the receiver, hence DM. These
                        rooms have nothing special other the fact that they
                        only have 2 members and them being the sender and
                        recipient respectively. If such a room is found, the
                        first one found will be used as destination. If no
                        such room is found, the send fails and the user should
                        do a --room-create and --room-invite first. If
                        multiple such rooms exist, one of them will be used
                        (arbitrarily). For sending and listening, specifying a
                        room directly is always faster and more efficient than
                        specifying a user. So, if you know the room, it is
                        preferred to use --room instead of --user. For b) and
                        c) --user can be specified in 3 ways: 1) full user id
                        as in '@john:example.org', 2) partial user id as in
                        '@john' when the user is on the same homeserver
                        (example.org will be automatically appended), or 3) a
                        display name as in 'john'. Be careful, when using
                        display names as they might not be unique, and you
                        could be sending to the wrong person. To see possible
                        display names use the --joined-members '*' option
                        which will show you the display names in the middle
                        column.
  --user-login USER     Specify user for --login. Details:: Optional argument
                        to specify the user for --login. This gives the option
                        to specify the user id for login. For '--login sso'
                        the --user-login is not needed as user id can be
                        obtained from server via SSO. For '--login password',
                        if not provided it will be queried via keyboard. A
                        full user id like '@john:example.com', a partial user
                        name like '@john', and a short user name like 'john'
                        can be given. --user-login is only used by --login and
                        ignored by all other actions.
  --name ROOM_NAME [ROOM_NAME ...]
                        Specify one or multiple room names. Details:: This
                        option is only meaningful in combination with option
                        --room-create. This option --name specifies the names
                        to be used with the command --room-create.
  --topic ROOM_TOPIC [ROOM_TOPIC ...]
                        Specify one or multiple room topics. Details:: This
                        option is only meaningful in combination with option
                        --room-create. This option --topic specifies the
                        topics to be used with the command --room-create.
  --alias ROOM_ALIAS [ROOM_ALIAS ...]
                        Specify one or multiple room aliases. Details:: This
                        option is only meaningful in combination with option
                        --room-dm-create. This option --alias specifies the
                        aliases to be used with the command --room-dm-create.
  -m TEXT [TEXT ...], --message TEXT [TEXT ...]
                        Send one or multiple text messages. Details:: Message
                        data must not be binary data, it must be text. If no
                        '-m' is used and no other conflicting arguments are
                        provided, and information is piped into the program,
                        then the piped data will be used as message. Finally,
                        if there are no operations at all in the arguments,
                        then a message will be read from stdin, i.e. from the
                        keyboard. This option can be used multiple times to
                        send multiple messages. If there is data piped into
                        this program, then first data from the pipe is
                        published, then messages from this option are
                        published. Messages will be sent last, i.e. after
                        objects like images, audio, files, events, etc. Input
                        piped via stdin can additionally be specified with the
                        special character '-'. If you want to feed a text
                        message into matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin,
                        then specify the special character '-'. If '-' is
                        specified as message, then the program will read the
                        message from stdin. With '-' the whole message, all
                        lines, will be considered a single message and sent as
                        one message. If your message is literally '-' then use
                        '\-' as message in the argument. '-' may appear in any
                        position, i.e. '-m "start" - "end"' will send 3
                        messages out of which the second one is read from
                        stdin. '-' may appear only once overall in all
                        arguments. Similar to '-', another shortcut character
                        is '_'. The special character '_' is used for
                        streaming data via a pipe on stdin. With '_' the stdin
                        pipe is read line-by-line and each line is treated as
                        a separate message and sent right away. The program
                        waits for pipe input until the pipe is closed. E.g.
                        Imagine a tool that generates output sporadically
                        24x7. It can be piped, i.e. streamed, into matrix-
                        commander, and matrix-commander stays active, sending
                        all input instantly. If you want to send the literal
                        letter '_' then escape it and send '\_'. '_' can be
                        used only once. And either '-' or '_' can be used.
  -i IMAGE_FILE [IMAGE_FILE ...], --image IMAGE_FILE [IMAGE_FILE ...]
                        Send one or multiple image files. Details:: This
                        option can be used multiple times to send multiple
                        images. First images are sent, then text messages are
                        sent. If you want to feed an image into matrix-
                        commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify the
                        special character '-'. If '-' is specified as image
                        file name, then the program will read the image data
                        from stdin. If your image file is literally named '-'
                        then use '\-' as file name in the argument. '-' may
                        appear in any position, i.e. '-i image1.jpg -
                        image3.png' will send 3 images out of which the second
                        one is read from stdin. '-' may appear only once
                        overall in all arguments. If the file exists already,
                        it is more efficient to specify the file name than to
                        pipe the file through stdin.
  -a AUDIO_FILE [AUDIO_FILE ...], --audio AUDIO_FILE [AUDIO_FILE ...]
                        Send one or multiple audio files. Details:: This
                        option can be used multiple times to send multiple
                        audio files. First audios are sent, then text messages
                        are sent. If you want to feed an audio into matrix-
                        commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify the
                        special character '-'. See description of '-i' to see
                        how '-' is handled.
  -f FILE [FILE ...], --file FILE [FILE ...]
                        Send one or multiple files (e.g. PDF, DOC, MP4).
                        Details:: This option can be used multiple times to
                        send multiple files. First files are sent, then text
                        messages are sent. If you want to feed a file into
                        matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify
                        the special character '-'. See description of '-i' to
                        see how '-' is handled.
  -e MATRIX_JSON_OBJECT [MATRIX_JSON_OBJECT ...], --event MATRIX_JSON_OBJECT [MATRIX_JSON_OBJECT ...]
                        Send a Matrix JSON event. Details:: Send an event that
                        is formatted as a JSON object as specified by the
                        Matrix protocol. This allows the advanced user to send
                        additional types of events such as reactions, send
                        replies to previous events, or edit previous messages.
                        Specifications for events can be found at
                        https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/. This
                        option can be used multiple times to send multiple
                        events. First events are sent, then text messages are
                        sent. If you want to feed an event into matrix-
                        commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify the
                        special character '-'. See description of '-i' to see
                        how '-' is handled. See tests/test-event.sh for
                        examples.
  -w, --html            Send message as format "HTML". Details:: If not
                        specified, message will be sent as format "TEXT". E.g.
                        that allows some text to be bold, etc. Only a subset
                        of HTML tags are accepted by Matrix.
  -z, --markdown        Send message as format "MARKDOWN". Details:: If not
                        specified, message will be sent as format "TEXT". E.g.
                        that allows sending of text formatted in MarkDown
                        language.
  -k, --code            Send message as format "CODE". Details:: If not
                        specified, message will be sent as format "TEXT". If
                        both --html and --code are specified then --code takes
                        priority. This is useful for sending ASCII-art or
                        tabbed output like tables as a fixed-sized font will
                        be used for display.
  -j, --emojize         Send message after emojizing. Details:: If not
                        specified, message will be sent as format "TEXT". If
                        both --code and --emojize are specified then --code
                        takes priority. This is useful for sending emojis in
                        shortcode form :collision:.
  -p SEPARATOR, --split SEPARATOR
                        Split message text into multiple Matrix messages.
                        Details:: If set, split the message(s) into multiple
                        messages wherever the string specified with --split
                        occurs. E.g. One pipes a stream of RSS articles into
                        the program and the articles are separated by three
                        newlines. Then with --split set to "\n\n\n" each
                        article will be printed in a separate message. By
                        default, i.e. if not set, no messages will be split.
  --config CONFIG_FILE  Specify the location of a config file. Details:: By
                        default, no config file is used. If this option is
                        provided, the provided file name will be used to read
                        configuration from. Not implemented.
  --proxy PROXY         Specify a proxy for connectivity. Details:: By
                        default, i.e. if this option is not set, no proxy is
                        used. If this option is used a proxy URL must be
                        provided. The provided proxy URL will be used for the
                        HTTP connection to the server. The proxy supports
                        SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5, and HTTP (tunneling). Examples of
                        valid URLs are "http://10.10.10.10:8118" or
                        "socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080". URLs with
                        "https" or "socks4a" are not valid. Only "http",
                        "socks4" and "socks5" are valid.
  -n, --notice          Send message as notice. Details:: If not specified,
                        message will be sent as text.
  --encrypted           Send message end-to-end encrypted. Details::
                        Encryption is always turned on and will always be used
                        where possible. It cannot be turned off. This flag
                        does nothing as encryption is turned on with or
                        without this argument. This flag exists only for
                        historic reasons. In some specific case encryption can
                        be disabled, please see --plain.
  -l [NEVER|ONCE|FOREVER|TAIL|ALL], --listen [NEVER|ONCE|FOREVER|TAIL|ALL]
                        Print received messages and listen to messages.
                        Details:: The --listen option takes one argument.
                        There are several choices: "never", "once", "forever",
                        "tail", and "all". By default, --listen is set to
                        "never". So, by default no listening will be done. Set
                        it to "forever" to listen for and print incoming
                        messages to stdout. "--listen forever" will listen to
                        all messages on all rooms forever. To stop listening
                        "forever", use Control-C on the keyboard or send a
                        signal to the process or service. The PID for
                        signaling can be found in a PID file in directory
                        "/home/user/.run". "--listen once" will get all the
                        messages from all rooms that are currently queued up.
                        So, with "once" the program will start, print waiting
                        messages (if any) and then stop. The timeout for
                        "once" is set to 10 seconds. So, be patient, it might
                        take up to that amount of time. "tail" reads and
                        prints the last N messages from the specified rooms,
                        then quits. The number N can be set with the --tail
                        option. With "tail" some messages read might be old,
                        i.e. already read before, some might be new, i.e.
                        never read before. It prints the messages and then the
                        program stops. Messages are sorted, last-first. Look
                        at --tail as that option is related to --listen tail.
                        The option "all" gets all messages available, old and
                        new. Unlike "once" and "forever" that listen in ALL
                        rooms, "tail" and "all" listen only to the room
                        specified in the credentials file or the --room
                        options.
  -t [NUMBER], --tail [NUMBER]
                        Print last messages. Details:: The --tail option reads
                        and prints up to the last N messages from the
                        specified rooms, then quits. It takes one argument, an
                        integer, which we call N here. If there are fewer than
                        N messages in a room, it reads and prints up to N
                        messages. It gets the last N messages in reverse
                        order. It print the newest message first, and the
                        oldest message last. If --listen-self is not set it
                        will print less than N messages in many cases because
                        N messages are obtained, but some of them are
                        discarded by default if they are from the user itself.
                        Look at --listen as this option is related to --tail.
  -y, --listen-self     Print your own messages as well. Details:: If set and
                        listening, then program will listen to and print also
                        the messages sent by its own user. By default messages
                        from oneself are not printed.
  --print-event-id      Print event ids of received messages. Details:: If set
                        and listening, then 'matrix-commander' will print also
                        the event id for each received message or other
                        received event. If set and sending, then 'matrix-
                        commander' will print the event id of the sent message
                        or the sent object (audio, file, event) to stdout.
                        Other information like room id and reference to what
                        was sent will be printed too. For sending this is
                        useful, if after sending the user wishes to perform
                        further operations on the sent object, e.g.
                        redacting/deleting it after an expiration time, etc.
  --download-media [DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY]
                        Download media files while listening. Details:: If set
                        and listening, then program will download received
                        media files (e.g. image, audio, video, text, PDF
                        files). By default, media will be downloaded to this
                        directory: "./media/". You can overwrite default with
                        your preferred directory. If you provide a relative
                        path, the relative path will be relative to the local
                        directory. foo will become ./foo. foo/foo will become
                        ./foo/foo and only works if ./foo already exists.
                        Absolute paths will remein unchanged. /tmp will remain
                        /tmp. /tmp/foo will be /tmp/foo. If media is encrypted
                        it will be decrypted and stored decrypted. By default
                        media files will not be downloaded.
  --download-media-name SOURCE|CLEAN|EVENTID|TIME
                        Specify the method to derive the media filename.
                        Details:: This argument is optional. Currently four
                        choices are offered: 'source', 'clean', 'eventid', and
                        'time'. 'source' means the value specified by the
                        source (sender) will be used. If the sender, i.e.
                        source, specifies a value that is not a valid
                        filename, then a failure will occur and the media file
                        will not be saved. 'clean' means that all unusual
                        characters in the name provided by the source will be
                        replaced by an underscore to create a valid file name.
                        'eventid' means that the name provided by the source
                        will be ignored and the event-id will be used instead.
                        'time' means that the name provided by the source will
                        be ignored and the current time at the receiver will
                        be used instead. As an example, if the source/sender
                        provided 'image(1)!.jpg' as name for a given media
                        file then 'source' will store the media using filename
                        'image(1)!.jpg', 'clean' will store it as
                        'image_1__.jpg', 'eventid' as something like
                        '$rsad57dafs57asfag45gsFjdTXW1dsfroBiO2IsidKk', and
                        'time' as something like '20231012_152234_266600'
                        (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_MICROSECONDS). If not specified this
                        value defaults to 'clean'.
  --os-notify           Notify me of arriving messages. Details:: If set and
                        listening, then program will attempt to visually
                        notify of arriving messages through the operating
                        system. By default there is no notification via OS.
  --set-device-name DEVICE_NAME
                        Set or rename the current device. Details:: Set or
                        rename the current device to the device name provided.
                        Send, listen and verify operations are allowed when
                        renaming the device.
  --set-display-name DISPLAY_NAME
                        Set or rename the display name. Details:: Set or
                        rename the display name for the current user to the
                        display name provided. Send, listen and verify
                        operations are allowed when setting the display name.
                        Do not confuse this option with the option '--get-
                        room-info' which gets the room display name, not the
                        user display name.
  --get-display-name    Get the display name of yourself. Details:: Get the
                        display name of matrix-commander (itself), or of one
                        or multiple users. Specify user(s) with the --user
                        option. If no user is specified get the display name
                        of itself. Send, listen and verify operations are
                        allowed when getting display name(s). Do not confuse
                        this option with the option '--get-room-info' which
                        gets the room display name, not the user display name.
  --set-presence ONLINE|OFFLINE|UNAVAILABLE
                        Set your presence. Details:: Set presence of matrix-
                        commander to the given value. Must be one of these
                        values: “online”, “offline”, “unavailable”. Otherwise
                        an error will be produced.
  --get-presence        Get your presence. Details:: Get presence of matrix-
                        commander (itself), or of one or multiple users.
                        Specify user(s) with the --user option. If no user is
                        specified get the presence of itself. Send, listen and
                        verify operations are allowed when getting
                        presence(s).
  --upload FILE [FILE ...]
                        Upload one or multiple files to the content
                        repository. Details:: The files will be given a Matrix
                        URI and stored on the server. --upload allows the
                        optional argument --plain to skip encryption for
                        upload. See tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --download MXC_URI [MXC_URI ...]
                        Download one or multiple files from the content
                        repository. Details:: You must provide one or multiple
                        Matrix URIs (MXCs) which are strings like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'. If found they
                        will be downloaded, decrypted, and stored in local
                        files. If file names are specified with --file-name
                        the downloads will be saved with these file names. If
                        --file-name is not specified the original file name
                        from the upload will be used. If neither specified nor
                        available on server, then the file name of last resort
                        'mxc-<mxc-id>' will be used. If a file name in --file-
                        name contains the placeholder __mxc_id__, it will be
                        replaced with the mxc-id. If a file name is specified
                        as empty string in --file-name, then also the name
                        'mxc-<mxc-id>' will be used. By default, the upload
                        was encrypted so a decryption dictionary must be
                        provided to decrypt the data. Specify one or multiple
                        decryption keys with --key-dict. If --key-dict is not
                        set, not decryption is attempted; and the data might
                        be stored in encrypted fashion, or might be plain-text
                        if the --upload skipped encryption with --plain. See
                        tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --delete-mxc MXC_URI [MXC_URI ...]
                        Delete one or multiple objects from the content
                        repository. Details:: You must provide one or multiple
                        Matrix URIs (MXC) which are strings like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'. Alternatively,
                        you can just provide the MXC id, i.e. the part after
                        the last slash. If found they (i.e. the files they
                        represent) will be deleted from the server database.
                        In order to delete objects one must have server admin
                        permissions. Having only room admin permissions is not
                        sufficient and it will fail. Read https://matrix-org.g
                        ithub.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api
                        / for learning how to set server admin permissions on
                        the server. Alternatively, and optionally, one can
                        specify an access token which has server admin
                        permissions with the --access-token argument. See
                        tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --delete-mxc-before TIMESTAMP [TIMESTAMP ...]
                        Delete old objects from the content
                        repositoryDetails:: Delete files from the content
                        repository that are older than a given timestamp. It
                        is the timestamp of last access, not the timestamp
                        when the file was created. Additionally you can
                        specify a size in bytes to indicate that only files
                        older than timestamp and larger than size will be
                        deleted. You must provide a timestamp of the following
                        format: 'DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS' like '20.01.2022
                        19:38:42' for January 20, 2022, 7pm 38min 42sec. Files
                        that are still used in image data (e.g user profile,
                        room avatar) will not be deleted from the server
                        database. In order to delete objects one must have
                        server admin permissions. Having only room admin
                        permissions is not sufficient and it will fail. Read
                        https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/admi
                        nistration/admin_api/ for learning how to set server
                        admin permissions on the server. Alternatively, and
                        optionally, one can specify an access token which has
                        server admin permissions with the --access-token
                        argument. See tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --joined-rooms        Print the list of joined rooms. Details:: All rooms
                        that you are a member of will be printed, one room per
                        line.
  --joined-members ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Print the list of joined members for one or multiple
                        rooms. Details:: If you want to print the joined
                        members of all rooms that you are member of, then use
                        the special character '*'.
  --joined-dm-rooms USER [USER ...]
                        Print the list of joined DM rooms for one or multiple
                        users. Details:: For each user specified, it prints
                        all DM rooms that you share with the specified user.
                        There might be 0, 1, or multiple DM rooms for a given
                        user. Short user names like 'john' can be also be
                        given. If you want to print all DM rooms that you are
                        member of, then use the special character '*'. For
                        each DM room found a single line of output is printed.
  --mxc-to-http MXC_URI [MXC_URI ...]
                        Convert MXC URIs to HTTP URLs. Details:: Convert one
                        or more matrix content URIs to the corresponding HTTP
                        URLs. The MXC URIs to provide look something like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'. See tests/test-
                        upload.sh for an example.
  --devices, --get-devices
                        Print the list of devices. Details:: All device of
                        this account will be printed, one device per line.
  --discovery-info      Print discovery information about current homeserver.
                        Details:: Note that not all homeservers support
                        discovery and an error might be reported.
  --login-info          Print login methods supported by the homeserver.
                        Details:: It prints one login method per line.
  --content-repository-config
                        Print the content repository configuration. Details::
                        This currently just prints the upload size limit in
                        bytes.
  --rest REST_METHOD DATA URL [REST_METHOD DATA URL ...]
                        Use the Matrix Client REST API. Details:: Matrix has
                        several extensive REST APIs. With the --rest argument
                        you can invoke a Matrix REST API call. This allows the
                        user to do pretty much anything, at the price of not
                        being very convenient. The APIs are described in
                        https://matrix.org/docs/api/,
                        https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/,
                        https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/admi
                        nistration/admin_api/, etc. Each REST call requires
                        exactly 3 arguments. So, the total number of arguments
                        used with --rest must be a multiple of 3. The argument
                        triples are: (a) the method, a string of GET, POST,
                        PUT, DELETE, or OPTIONS. (b) a string containing the
                        data (if any) in JSON format. (c) a string containing
                        the URL. All strings must be UTF-8. There are a few
                        placeholders. They are: __homeserver__ (like
                        https://matrix.example.org), __hostname__ (like
                        matrix.example.org), __access_token__, __user_id__
                        (like @mc:matrix.example.com), __device_id__, and
                        __room_id__. If a placeholder is found it is replaced
                        with the value from the local credentials file. An
                        example would be: --rest 'GET' ''
                        '__homeserver__/_matrix/client/versions'. If there is
                        no data, i.e. data (b) is empty, then use '' for it.
                        Optionally, --access-token can be used to overwrite
                        the access token from credentials (if needed). See
                        tests/test-rest.sh for an example.
  --set-avatar AVATAR_MXC_URI
                        Set your avatar. Details:: Set the avatar MXC resource
                        used by matrix-commander. Provide one MXC URI that
                        looks like this 'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'.
  --get-avatar [USER ...]
                        Get an avatar. Details:: Get the avatar MXC resource
                        used by matrix-commander, or one or multiple other
                        users. Specify zero or more user ids. If no user id is
                        specified, the avatar of matrix-commander will be
                        fetched. If one or more user ids are given, the
                        avatars of these users will be fetched. As response
                        both MXC URI as well as URL will be printed.
  --get-profile [USER ...]
                        Get a user profile. Details:: Get the user profile
                        used by matrix-commander, or one or multiple other
                        users. Specify zero or more user ids. If no user id is
                        specified, the user profile of matrix-commander will
                        be fetched. If one or more user ids are given, the
                        user profiles of these users will be fetched. As
                        response display name and avatar MXC URI as well as
                        possible additional profile information (if present)
                        will be printed. One line per user will be printed.
  --get-room-info [ROOM ...]
                        Get the room information. Details:: Get the room
                        information such as room display name, room alias,
                        room creator, etc. for one or multiple specified
                        rooms. The included room 'display name' is also
                        referred to as 'room name' or incorrectly even as room
                        title. If one or more room are given, the room
                        informations of these rooms will be fetched. If no
                        room is specified, the room information for the
                        default room configured for matrix-commander is
                        fetched. Rooms can be given via room id (e.g.
                        '\!SomeRoomId:matrix.example.com'), canonical (full)
                        room alias (e.g. '#SomeRoomAlias:matrix.example.com'),
                        or short alias (e.g. 'SomeRoomAlias' or
                        '#SomeRoomAlias'). As response room id, room display
                        name, room canonical alias, room topic, room creator,
                        and room encryption are printed. One line per room
                        will be printed. Since either room id or room alias
                        are accepted as input and both room id and room alias
                        are given as output, one can hence use this option to
                        map from room id to room alias as well as vice versa
                        from room alias to room id. Do not confuse this option
                        with the options '--get-display-name' and '--set-
                        display-name', which get/set the user display name,
                        not the room display name.
  --get-client-info     Print client information. Details:: Print information
                        kept in the client, i.e. matrix-commander. Output is
                        printed in JSON format.
  --has-permission ROOM BAN|INVITE|KICK|NOTIFICATIONS|REDACT|etc [ROOM BAN|INVITE|KICK|NOTIFICATIONS|REDACT|etc ...]
                        Inquire about permissions. Details:: Inquire if user
                        used by matrix-commander has permission for one or
                        multiple actions in one or multiple rooms. Each
                        inquiry requires 2 parameters: the room id and the
                        permission type. One or multiple of these parameter
                        pairs may be specified. For each parameter pair there
                        will be one line printed to stdout. Values for the
                        permission type are 'ban', 'invite', 'kick',
                        'notifications', 'redact', etc. See
                        https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/client-server-
                        api/#mroompower_levels.
  --import-keys FILE PASSPHRASE FILE PASSPHRASE
                        Import Megolm decryption keys from a file. Details::
                        This is an optional argument. If used it must be
                        followed by two values. (a) a file name from which the
                        keys will be read. (b) a passphrase with which the
                        file can be decrypted with. The keys will be added to
                        the current instance as well as written to the
                        database. See also --export-keys.
  --export-keys FILE PASSPHRASE FILE PASSPHRASE
                        Export all the Megolm decryption keys of this device.
                        Details:: This is an optional argument. If used it
                        must be followed by two values. (a) a file name to
                        which the keys will be written to. (b) a passphrase
                        with which the file will be encrypted with. Note that
                        this does not save other information such as the
                        private identity keys of the device.
  --room-set-alias ROOM_ALIAS ROOM [ROOM_ALIAS ROOM ...], --room-put-alias ROOM_ALIAS ROOM [ROOM_ALIAS ROOM ...]
                        Add aliases to rooms. Details:: Add an alias to a
                        room, or aliases to multiple rooms. Provide pairs of
                        arguments. In each pair, the first argument must be
                        the alias you want to assign to the room given via
                        room id in the second argument of the pair. E.g. the 4
                        arguments 'a1 r1 a2 r2' would assign the alias 'a1' to
                        room 'r1' and the alias 'a2' to room 'r2'. If you just
                        have one single pair then the second argument is
                        optional. If just a single value is given (an alias)
                        then this alias is assigned to the default room of
                        matrix-commander (as found in credentials file). In
                        short, you can have just a single argument or an even
                        number of arguments forming pairs. You can have
                        multiple room aliases per room. So, you may add
                        multiple aliases to the same room. A room alias looks
                        like this: '#someRoomAlias:matrix.example.org'. Short
                        aliases like 'someRoomAlias' or '#someRoomAlias' are
                        also accepted. In case of a short alias, it will be
                        automatically prefixed with '#' and the homeserver
                        will be automatically appended. Adding the same alias
                        multiple times to the same room results in an error.
                        --room-put-alias is eqivalent to --room-set-alias.
  --room-resolve-alias ROOM_ALIAS [ROOM_ALIAS ...]
                        Show room ids corresponding to room aliases. Details::
                        Resolves a room alias to the corresponding room id, or
                        multiple room aliases to their corresponding room ids.
                        Provide one or multiple room aliases. A room alias
                        looks like this: '#someRoomAlias:matrix.example.org'.
                        Short aliases like 'someRoomAlias' or '#someRoomAlias'
                        are also accepted. In case of a short alias, it will
                        be automatically prefixed with '#' and the homeserver
                        from the default room of matrix-commander (as found in
                        credentials file) will be automatically appended.
                        Resolving an alias that does not exist results in an
                        error. For each room alias one line will be printed to
                        stdout with the result.
  --room-delete-alias ROOM_ALIAS [ROOM_ALIAS ...]
                        Delete one or multiple rooms aliases. Details::
                        Provide one or multiple room aliases. You can have
                        multiple room aliases per room. So, you may delete
                        multiple aliases from the same room or from different
                        rooms. A room alias looks like this:
                        '#someRoomAlias:matrix.example.org'. Short aliases
                        like 'someRoomAlias' or '#someRoomAlias' are also
                        accepted. In case of a short alias, it will be
                        automatically prefixed with '#' and the homeserver
                        from the default room of matrix-commander (as found in
                        credentials file) will be automatically appended.
                        Deleting an alias that does not exist results in an
                        error.
  --get-openid-token [USER ...]
                        Get an OpenID token. Details:: Get an OpenID token for
                        matrix-commander, or for one or multiple other users.
                        It prints an OpenID token object that the requester
                        may supply to another service to verify their identity
                        in Matrix. See http://www.openid.net/. Specify zero or
                        more user ids. If no user id is specified, an OpenID
                        for matrix-commander will be fetched. If one or more
                        user ids are given, the OpenID of these users will be
                        fetched. As response the user id(s) and OpenID(s) will
                        be printed.
  --room-get-visibility [ROOM ...]
                        Get the visibility of one or more rooms. Details::
                        Provide zero or more room ids as arguments. If no
                        argument is given, then the default room of matrix-
                        commander (as found in credentials file) will be used.
                        For each room the visibility will be printed.
                        Currently, this is either the string 'private' or
                        'public'. As response one line per room will be
                        printed to stdout.
  --room-get-state [ROOM ...]
                        Get the state of one or more rooms. Details::Provide
                        zero or more room ids as arguments. If no argument is
                        given, then the default room of matrix-commander (as
                        found in credentials file) will be used. For each room
                        the state will be printed. The state is a long list of
                        events including events like 'm.room.create',
                        'm.room.encryption', 'm.room.guest_access',
                        'm.room.history_visibility', 'm.room.join_rules',
                        'm.room.member', 'm.room.power_levels', etc. As
                        response one line per room will be printed to stdout.
                        The line can be very long as the list of events can be
                        very large. To get output into a human readable form
                        pipe output through sed and jq as shown in an example
                        in tests/test-setget.sh.
  --delete-device DEVICE [DEVICE ...]
                        Delete one or multiple devices. Details:: By default
                        devices belonging to matrix-commander will be deleted.
                        If the devices belong to a different user, use the
                        --user argument to specify the user, i.e. owner. Only
                        exactly one user can be specified with the optional
                        --user argument. Device deletion requires the user
                        password. It must be specified with the --password
                        argument. If the server uses only HTTP (and not
                        HTTPS), then the password can be visible to attackers.
                        Hence, if the server does not support HTTPS this
                        operation is discouraged.
  --room-redact ROOM_ID EVENT_ID REASON [ROOM_ID EVENT_ID REASON ...], --room-delete-content ROOM_ID EVENT_ID REASON [ROOM_ID EVENT_ID REASON ...]
                        Strip information out of one or several events.
                        Details:: Strip information from events, e.g.
                        messages. Redact is used in the meaning of 'strip,
                        wipe, black-out', not in the meaning of 'edit'. This
                        action removes, deletes the content of an event while
                        not removing the event. You can wipe text from a
                        previous message, etc. Typical Matrix clients like
                        Element will delete messages, images and other objects
                        from the GUI once they have been redacted. So, --room-
                        redact is a way to delete a message, images, etc. The
                        content is wiped, the GUI deletes the message, but the
                        server keeps the event history. Note, while this
                        deletes from the client (GUI, e.g. Element), it does
                        not delete from the database on the server. So, this
                        call is not a way to clean up the server database.
                        Each redact (wipe, strip, delete) operation requires
                        exactly 3 arguments. The argument triples are: (a) the
                        room id. (b) the id of the event to be redacted. (c) a
                        string containing the reason for the redaction. Use ''
                        if you do not want to give a reason. So, the total
                        number of arguments used with --room-redact must be a
                        multiple of 3, but we also accept 2 in which case only
                        one redaction will be done without specifying a
                        reason. Event ids start with the dollar sign ($).
                        Depending on your shell, you might have to escape the
                        '$' to '\$'. --room-delete-content is an alias for
                        --room-redact. They can be used interchangeably.
  --whoami              Print your user id. Details:: Print the user id used
                        by matrix-commander (itself). One can get this
                        information also by looking at the credentials file.
  --no-ssl              Skip SSL verification. Details:: By default (if this
                        option is not used) the SSL certificate is validated
                        for the connection. But, if this option is used, then
                        the SSL certificate validation will be skipped. This
                        is useful for home-servers that have no SSL
                        certificate. If used together with the "--ssl-
                        certificate" parameter, this option is meaningless and
                        an error will be raised.
  --ssl-certificate SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE
                        Use your own SSL certificate. Details:: Use this
                        option to use your own local SSL certificate file.
                        This is an optional parameter. This is useful for home
                        servers that have their own SSL certificate. This
                        allows you to use HTTPS/TLS for the connection while
                        using your own local SSL certificate. Specify the path
                        and file to your SSL certificate. If used together
                        with the "--no-ssl" parameter, this option is
                        meaningless and an error will be raised.
  --file-name FILE [FILE ...]
                        Specify one or multiple file names for some actions.
                        Details:: This is an optional argument. Use this
                        option in combination with options like --download to
                        specify one or multiple file names. Ignored if used by
                        itself without an appropriate corresponding action.
  --key-dict KEY_DICTIONARY [KEY_DICTIONARY ...]
                        Specify one or multiple key dictionaries for
                        decryption. Details:: One or multiple decryption
                        dictionaries are provided by the --upload action as a
                        result. A decryption dictionary is a string like this:
                        "{'v': 'v2', 'key': {'kty': 'oct', 'alg': 'A256CTR',
                        'ext': True, 'k': 'somekey', 'key_ops': ['encrypt',
                        'decrypt']}, 'iv': 'someiv', 'hashes': {'sha256':
                        'someSHA'}}". If you have a list of key dictionaries
                        and want to skip one, use the empty string.
  --plain               Disable encryption for a specific action. Details:: By
                        default, everything is always encrypted. Actions that
                        support this option are: --upload, --room-create, and
                        --room-dm-create. Rooms are by default created
                        encrypted; to overwrite that and to create a room with
                        encryption disabled use '--plain'. See the individual
                        commands.
  --separator SEPARATOR
                        Set a custom separator used for certain print outs.
                        Details:: By default, i.e. if --separator is not used,
                        4 spaces are used as separator between columns in
                        print statements. You could set it to '\t' if you
                        prefer a tab, but tabs are usually replaced with
                        spaces by the terminal. So, that might not give you
                        what you want. Maybe ' || ' is an alternative choice.
  --access-token ACCESS_TOKEN
                        Set a custom access token for use by certain actions.
                        Details:: It is an optional argument. By default
                        --access-token is ignored and not used. It is used by
                        the --delete-mxc, --delete-mxc-before, and --rest
                        actions.
  --password PASSWORD   Specify a password for use by certain actions.
                        Details:: It is an optional argument. By default
                        --password is ignored and not used. It is used by '--
                        login password' and '--delete-device' actions. If not
                        provided for --login the user will be queried via
                        keyboard.
  --homeserver HOMESERVER_URL
                        Specify a homeserver for use by certain actions.
                        Details:: It is an optional argument. By default
                        --homeserver is ignored and not used. It is used by '
                        --login' action. If not provided for --login the user
                        will be queried via keyboard.
  --device DEVICE_NAME  Specify a device name, for use by certain actions.
                        Details:: It is an optional argument. By default
                        --device is ignored and not used. It is used by '--
                        login' action. If not provided for --login the user
                        will be queried via keyboard. If you want the default
                        value specify ''. Multiple devices (with different
                        device id) may have the same device name. In short,
                        the same device name can be assigned to multiple
                        different devices if desired.
  --sync FULL|OFF       Choose synchronization options. Details:: This option
                        decides on whether the program synchronizes the state
                        with the server before a 'send' action. Currently two
                        choices are offered: 'full' and 'off'. Provide one of
                        these choices. The default is 'full'. If you want to
                        use the default, then there is no need to use this
                        option. If you have chosen 'full', the full state, all
                        state events will be synchronized between this program
                        and the server before a 'send'. If you have chosen
                        'off', synchronization will be skipped entirely before
                        the 'send' which will improve performance.
  -o TEXT|JSON|JSON-MAX|JSON-SPEC, --output TEXT|JSON|JSON-MAX|JSON-SPEC
                        Select an output format. Details:: This option decides
                        on how the output is presented. Currently offered
                        choices are: 'text', 'json', 'json-max', and 'json-
                        spec'. Provide one of these choices. The default is
                        'text'. If you want to use the default, then there is
                        no need to use this option. If you have chosen 'text',
                        the output will be formatted with the intention to be
                        consumed by humans, i.e. readable text. If you have
                        chosen 'json', the output will be formatted as JSON.
                        The content of the JSON object matches the data
                        provided by the matrix-nio SDK. In some occasions the
                        output is enhanced by having a few extra data items
                        added for convenience. In most cases the output will
                        be processed by other programs rather than read by
                        humans. Option 'json-max' is practically the same as
                        'json', but yet another additional field is added. The
                        data item 'transport_response' which gives information
                        on how the data was obtained and transported is also
                        being added. For '--listen' a few more fields are
                        added. In most cases the output will be processed by
                        other programs rather than read by humans. Option
                        'json-spec' only prints information that adheres
                        1-to-1 to the Matrix Specification. Currently only the
                        events on '--listen' and '--tail' provide data exactly
                        as in the Matrix Specification. If no data is
                        available that corresponds exactly with the Matrix
                        Specification, no data will be printed. In short,
                        currently '--json-spec' only provides outputs for '--
                        listen' and '--tail'. All other arguments like '--get-
                        room-info' will print no output.
  --room-invites [LIST|JOIN|LIST+JOIN]
                        List room invitations and/or join invited rooms.
                        Details:: This option takes zero or one argument. If
                        no argument is given, 'list' is assumed which will
                        list all room invitation events as they are received.
                        Listing will print the room id and other information
                        to standard output. 'join' will join the room(s) each
                        time a room invitation is received. 'list+join' will
                        do both, list the invitations as well as automatically
                        join the rooms to which an invitation was received. '
                        --room-invites' can be combined with '--listen'. If
                        and only if '--listen forever' is used, will the
                        program listen continuously for room invites. In all
                        other cases, the program only looks for room
                        invitation events once; and it does so before any
                        possible listening to messages. Warning: events are
                        usually delivered once. So, if you listen for and list
                        invites you will get them and list them the first time
                        you run '--room-invites list'. On the second run of '
                        --room-invites list' the events will not be replayed
                        and not be listed. Hence, if you list the invites, you
                        might want to store the output (room id) so that you
                        can join the room later with '--room-join' for
                        example. Don't confuse this option with --room-invite.
  -v [PRINT|CHECK], -V [PRINT|CHECK], --version [PRINT|CHECK]
                        Print version information or check for updates.
                        Details:: This option takes zero or one argument. If
                        no argument is given, 'print' is assumed which will
                        print the version of the currently installed
                        'PROG_WITHOUT_EXT' package. 'check' is the
                        alternative. '{CHECK}' connects to https://pypi.org
                        and gets the version number of latest stable release.
                        There is no 'calling home' on every run, only a 'check
                        pypi.org' upon request. Your privacy is protected. The
                        new release is neither downloaded, nor installed. It
                        just informs you. After printing version information
                        the program will continue to run. This is useful for
                        having version number in the log files.

# Autocompletion

Tab completion is provided for shells (e.g. bash), courtesy of @mizlan).

Here is a sample snapshot of tab completion in action:

# Performance and Speed

- `matrix-commander` is written in Python and hence rather on the slow side
- It is not thread-safe. One cannot just simply run multiple instances
  at the same time. However, with very careful set-up one can run
  multiple instances, but that is not the target use case. See
  [Issue #31](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/issues/31).
- Where possible bundle several actions together into a single call.
  For example if one wants to send 8 images, then it is significantly faster
  to call `matrix-commander` once with `-i` specifying 8 images, than
  to call `matrix-commander` 8 times with one image each call. One needs
  to send 5 messages, 10 images, 5 audios, 3 PDF files and 7 events to
  the same user? Call `matrix-commander` once, not 30 times.
- If you are sending something, then try the `--sync off` option and see
  to what degree skipping the server sync for sending helps.
- Avoid using room aliases. Instead use room ids. For each room alias
  the corresponding id must be retrieved from the server creating overhead.

# For Developers

- Don't change tabbing, spacing, or formatting as file is automatically
  sorted, linted and formatted.
- `pylama:format=pep8:linters=pep8`
- first `isort` import sorter
- then `flake8` linter/formater
- then `black` linter/formater
- line length: 79
  - isort matrix_commander.py
  - flake8 matrix_commander.py
  - python3 -m black --line-length 79 matrix_commander.py
- There is a script called `lintmc.sh` in `scripts` directory for that.

# Semantic Versioning

A version number is defined by: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where
- MAJOR version changes when there is a incompatible API change
- MINOR version changes when there is added functionality in a
  backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version changes when there are backwards-compatible bug fixes.

See also Issue #109 for a discussion on this topic.

Output written to stdout (e.g. results on --room-get-info) is considered
part of the API. So, if there is added space this would cause a major
version change even though only a "meaningless" character has changed.

Debugging and logging output written to stderr (e.g. debug statements,
info, warning, and errors) are *not* part of the API. So, if the
description of an error changes than this is only a patch.
You should not rely on anything written to stderr or parse stderr or
log files. An example line is:
`2022-11-22 10:30:18,921:     ERROR: matrix-commander: E123 Failed ...`.
The format is: date, level, module, number and description.
Only warnings and errors have the `number` part.
An effort is made to keep the first parts of these lines up to `number`
the same for warnings and errors, and only change description.

Output of `--help` can also change and should not be relied on, changes to it
are just a patch.

Some actions return a JSON event and these JSON objects might change
as Matrix specifications change. This will not cause a version change in
matrix-commander.

When preparing to package `matrix-commander` for NIX the question
came up if `matrix-commander` is GPL3Only or GPL3Plus. GPL3PLus was
deemed to be better. As such the license was changed from GPL3Only
to GPL3Plus on May 25, 2021. Versions before this date are licensed
under GPL3. Versions on or after this date are GPL3Plus, i.e.
GPL3 or later.
