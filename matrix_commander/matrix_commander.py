# Summary, TLDR

This simple Matrix client written in Python allows you to send and
receive messages and files, verify other devices, and interact with
your Matrix account or other Matrix users in many ways.
You use it from the terminal (CLI) or integrate it into other simple
Python programs. Enjoy and please :star: star on Github.

# matrix-commander

Simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending, receiving,
creating rooms, inviting, verifying, and so much more.

- `matrix-commander` is a simple command-line [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
  client.
- It is a simple but convenient app to
    - send Matrix text messages as well as text, image, audio, video or
      other arbitrary files
    - listen to and receive Matrix messages, images, audio, video, etc.
    - download media files like images or audio
    - perform Matrix emoji verification
    - performs actions of rooms (create rooms, invite to rooms, etc.)
    - list rooms and room members
    - and much more
- It exclusively offers a command-line interface (CLI).
- Hence the word-play: matrix-command(lin)er
- There is no GUI and there are no windows (except for pop-up windows in
  OS notification)
- It uses the [matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/) SDK
- Both `matrix-nio` and `matrix-commander` are written in Python 3
- Convenient to install via `pip`.

# What for? Why? For whom? Use cases?

Use cases for this program could be
- a bot or part of a bot,
- to send alerts,
- combine it with `cron` to publish periodic data,
- send yourself daily/weekly reminders via a cron job
- send yourself a daily song from your music collection
- a trivial way to fire off some instant messages from the command line
- a trivial way to read messages in the terminal
- to automate sending via programs and scripts
- a "blogger" who frequently sends messages and images to the same
  room(s) could use it
- a person could write a diary or run a gratitude journal by
  sending messages to her/his own room
- as educational material that showcases the use of the `matrix-nio` SDK

# First Run, Set Up, Credentials File, End-to-end Encryption

This program on the first run creates a credentials.json file.
The credentials.json file stores: homeserver, user id,
access token, device id, and room id. On the first run
it asks some questions, creates the token and device id
and stores everything in the credentials.json file.

Since the credentials file holds an access token it
should be protected and secured. One can use different
credential files for different users or different rooms.

On creation the credentials file will always be created in the local
directory, so the users sees it right away. This is fine if you have
only one or a few credential files, but for better maintainability
it is suggested to place your credentials files into directory
$HOME/.config/matrix-commander/. When the program looks for
a credentials file it will first look in local directory and then
as secondary choice it will look in directory
$HOME/.config/matrix-commander/.

If you want to re-use an existing device id and an existing
access token, you can do so as well, just manually edit the
credentials file. However, for end-to-end encryption this will
NOT work.

End-to-end encryption (e2ee) is enabled by default. It cannot be turned off.
Wherever possible end-to-end encryption will be used. For e2ee to work
efficiently a `store` directory is needed to store e2ee data persistently.
The default location for the store directory is a local directory named
`store`. Alternatively, as a secondary choice the program looks for a store
directory in $HOME/.local/shared/matrix-commander/store/. The user can always
specify a different location via the --store argument. If needed the `store`
directory will be created on the first run.

From the second time the program is run, and on all
future runs it will use the homeserver, user id
and access token found in the credentials file to log
into the Matrix account. Now this program can be used
to easily send simple text messages, images, and so forth
to the just configured room.

# Sending

Messages to send can be provided
1) in the command line (-m or --message)
2) as input from the keyboard (if there is no other input or command)
3) through a pipe from stdin (|), i.e. piped in from another program.

For sending messages the program supports various text formats:
1) text: default
2) html:  HTML formatted text
3) markdown: MarkDown formatted text
4) code: used a block of fixed-sized font, ideal for ASCII art or
   tables, bash outputs, etc.
5) notification
6) split: splits messages into multiple units at given pattern

Photos and images that can be sent. That includes files like
.jpg, .gif, .png or .svg.

Arbitrary files like .txt, .pdf, .doc, audio files like .mp3
or video files like .mp4 can also be sent.

Matrix events like sending an emoji reaction, replying as a thread,
message edits can be sent.

# Listening, Receiving

One can listen to one or multiple rooms. Received messages will be displayed
on the screen. If desired, optionally, you can be notified of incoming
messages through the operating system standard notification system, usually a
small pop-up window.

Messages can be received or listened to various ways:
1) Forever: the program runs forever, listens forever, and prints all
   messages as they arrive in real-time.
2) Once: the program prints all the messages that are waiting in the queue,
   i.e. all messages that have been sent in, and after printing them the
   program terminates.
3) Tail: prints the last N read or unread messages of one or multiple
   specified rooms and after printing them the program terminates.

When listening to messages you can also choose to download and decrypt
media. Say, someone is sending a song. The mp3 file can be downloaded
and automatically decrypted for you.

# Verification

The program can accept verification request and verify other devices
via emojis. Do do so use the --verify option and the program will
await incoming verification request and act accordingly.

# Room Operations, Actions on Rooms

The program can create rooms, join, leave and forget rooms.
It can also send invitations to join rooms to
others (given that user has the appropriate permissions) as
well as ban, unban and kick other users from rooms.

# Dependencies and Installation

- If you install via `pip`, then `pip` will take care of most of the
  dependencies.
  - See https://pypi.org/project/matrix-commander
  - Usually `pip install matrix-commander` will do the trick.
  - Note that even if you install via `pip` you must have a) Python 3.8+
    and b) `libolm` installed. See `PyPi-Instructions.md`.

- If you install a docker image: `matrix-commander` is available on
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixcommander/matrix-commander)
  and hence easy to install as docker image (:clap: to @pataquets for his PR).
  Install via `docker pull matrixcommander/matrix-commander`.

- If you install it via `git` or via file download then these are the
  dependencies that you must take care of:

    - Python 3.8 or higher installed (3.7 will NOT work)
    - libolm-dev must be installed as it is required by matrix-nio
      - libolm-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, libolm-devel on Fedora, libolm on MacOS
    - matrix-nio must be installed, see https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade matrix-nio[e2e]
    - python3 package markdown must be installed to support MarkDown format
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade markdown
    - python3 package python_magic must be installed to support image sending
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade python_magic
    - if (and only if) you want OS notification support, then the python3
      package notify2 and dbus-python should be installed
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade dbus-python # optional
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade notify2 # optional
    - python3 package urllib must be installed to support media download
      - pip3 install --user --upgrade urllib
    - `matrix_commander/matrix_commander.py` file must be installed, and should
      have execution permissions
      - chmod 755 matrix_commander.py
    - `matrix_commander/matrix-commander` file is recommended for the install,
      and should have execution permissions
      - chmod 755 matrix-commander
    - for a full list or requirements look at the `requirements.txt` file
      - run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install
        all required Python packages
      - if you e.g. run on a headless server and don't want dbus-python and
        notify2, please remove the corresponding 2 lines from
        the `requirements.txt` file

# Examples of calling `matrix-commander`

- Alternative 1: Usually `matrix-commander` is called from a terminal
  inside a shell like `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, your Windows CMD terminal
  or similar. You will find plenty of examples how to use it within
  a terminal just a few lines down.
- Alternative 2: Sometimes, however, it might be more convenient to call
  `matrix-commander` from within a Python program. This is also possible.
  Import the Python module `matrix_commander` and use the provided
  entry point `main`. An example of how this can be done can be found
  in [tests/test-send.py](
  https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/blob/master/tests/test-send.py).

```
$ matrix-commander # first run; this will configure everything
$ matrix-commander --no-sso # alternative first run without Single Sign-On;
$   # this will configure everything on a headless server w/o a browser
$ # this created a credentials.json file, and a store directory.
$ # optionally, if you want you can move credentials to app config directory
$ mkdir $HOME/.config/matrix-commander # optional
$ mv -i credentials.json $HOME/.config/matrix-commander/
$ # optionally, if you want you can move store to the app share directory

Welcome to matrix-commander, a Matrix CLI client. ─── On first run this
program will configure itself. On further runs this program implements a
simple Matrix CLI client that can send messages, listen to messages, verify
devices, etc. It can send one or multiple message to one or multiple Matrix
rooms and/or users. The text messages can be of various formats such as
"text", "html", "markdown" or "code". Images, audio, arbitrary files, or
events can be sent as well. For receiving there are three main options: listen
forever, listen once and quit, and get the last N messages and quit. Emoji
verification is built-in which can be used to verify devices. End-to-end
encryption is enabled by default and cannot be turned off. ─── Bundling
several actions together into a single call to {PROG_WITHOUT_EXT} is faster
than calling {PROG_WITHOUT_EXT} multiple times with only one action. If there
are both 'set' and 'get' actions present in the arguments, then the 'set'
actions will be performed before the 'get' actions. ─── For even more
explications and examples also read the documentation provided in the on-line
Github README.md file or the README.md in your local installation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Print debug information. If used once, only the log
                        level of matrix-commander is set to DEBUG. If used
                        twice ("-d -d" or "-dd") then log levels of both
                        matrix-commander and underlying modules are set to
                        DEBUG. "-d" is a shortcut for "--log-level DEBUG". See
                        also --log-level. "-d" takes precedence over "--log-
                        level".
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL [LOG_LEVEL ...]
                        Set the log level(s). Possible values are "DEBUG",
                        "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", and "CRITICAL". If
                        --log_level is used with one level argument, only the
                        log level of matrix-commander is set to the specified
                        value. If --log_level is used with two level argument
                        (e.g. "--log-level WARNING ERROR") then log levels of
                        both matrix-commander and underlying modules are set
                        to the specified values. See also --debug.
  -c CREDENTIALS, --credentials CREDENTIALS
                        On first run, information about homeserver, user, room
                        id, etc. will be written to a credentials file. By
                        default, this file is "credentials.json". On further
                        runs the credentials file is read to permit logging
                        into the correct Matrix account and sending messages
                        to the preconfigured room. If this option is provided,
                        the provided file name will be used as credentials
                        file instead of the default one.
  -r ROOM [ROOM ...], --room ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Send to or receive from this room or these rooms.
                        None, one or multiple rooms can be specified. The
                        default room is provided in credentials file. If a
                        room (or multiple ones) is (or are) provided in the
                        arguments, then it (or they) will be used instead of
                        the one from the credentials file. The user must have
                        access to the specified room in order to send messages
                        there or listen on the room. Messages cannot be sent
                        to arbitrary rooms. When specifying the room id some
                        shells require the exclamation mark to be escaped with
                        a backslash. As an alternative to specifying a room as
                        destination, one can specify a user as a destination
                        with the '--user' argument. See '--user' and the term
                        'DM (direct messaging)' for details. Specifying a room
                        is always faster and more efficient than specifying a
                        user. Not all listen operations allow setting a room.
                        Read more under the --listen options and similar.
  --room-create ROOM_CREATE [ROOM_CREATE ...]
                        Create this room or these rooms. One or multiple room
                        aliases can be specified. The room (or multiple ones)
                        provided in the arguments will be created. The user
                        must be permitted to create rooms. Combine --room-
                        create with --name and --topic to add names and topics
                        to the room(s) to be created.
  --room-join ROOM_JOIN [ROOM_JOIN ...]
                        Join this room or these rooms. One or multiple room
                        aliases can be specified. The room (or multiple ones)
                        provided in the arguments will be joined. The user
                        must have permissions to join these rooms.
  --room-leave ROOM_LEAVE [ROOM_LEAVE ...]
                        Leave this room or these rooms. One or multiple room
                        aliases can be specified. The room (or multiple ones)
                        provided in the arguments will be left.
  --room-forget ROOM_FORGET [ROOM_FORGET ...]
                        After leaving a room you should (most likely) forget
                        the room. Forgetting a room removes the users' room
                        history. One or multiple room aliases can be
                        specified. The room (or multiple ones) provided in the
                        arguments will be forgotten. If all users forget a
                        room, the room can eventually be deleted on the
                        server.
  --room-invite ROOM_INVITE [ROOM_INVITE ...]
                        Invite one ore more users to join one or more rooms.
                        Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify
                        the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-invite. The user must have
                        permissions to invite users.
  --room-ban ROOM_BAN [ROOM_BAN ...]
                        Ban one ore more users from one or more rooms. Specify
                        the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify the rooms
                        as arguments to this option, i.e. as arguments to
                        --room-ban. The user must have permissions to ban
                        users.
  --room-unban ROOM_UNBAN [ROOM_UNBAN ...]
                        Unban one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify
                        the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-unban. The user must have
                        permissions to unban users.
  --room-kick ROOM_KICK [ROOM_KICK ...]
                        Kick one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify
                        the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-kick. The user must have
                        permissions to kick users.
  -u USER [USER ...], --user USER [USER ...]
                        Specify one or multiple users. This option is
                        meaningful in combination with a) room actions like
                        --room-invite, --room-ban, --room-unban, etc. and b)
                        send actions like -m, -i, -f, etc. as well as c) some
                        listen actions --listen. In case of a) this option
                        --user specifies the users to be used with room
                        commands (like invite, ban, etc.). In case of b) the
                        option --user can be used as an alternative to
                        specifying a room as destination for text (-m), images
                        (-i), etc. For send actions '--user' is providing the
                        functionality of 'DM (direct messaging)'. For c) this
                        option allows an alternative to specifying a room as
                        destination for some --listen actions. What is a DM?
                        matrix-commander tries to find a room that contains
                        only the sender and the receiver, hence DM. These
                        rooms have nothing special other the fact that they
                        only have 2 members and them being the sender and
                        recipient respectively. If such a room is found, the
                        first one found will be used as destination. If no
                        such room is found, the send fails and the user should
                        do a --room-create and --room-invite first. If
                        multiple such rooms exist, one of them will be used
                        (arbitrarily). For sending and listening, specifying a
                        room directly is always faster and more efficient than
                        specifying a user. So, if you know the room, it is
                        preferred to use --room instead of --user. For b) and
                        c) --user can be specified in 3 ways: 1) full user id
                        as in '@user:example.org', 2) partial user id as in
                        '@user' when the user is on the same homeserver
                        (example.org will be automatically appended), or 3) a
                        display name. Be careful, when using display names as
                        they might not be unique, and you could be sending to
                        the wrong person. To see possible display names use
                        the --joined-members '*' option which will show you
                        the display names in the middle column.
  --name NAME [NAME ...]
                        Specify one or multiple names. This option is only
                        meaningful in combination with option --room-create.
                        This option --name specifies the names to be used with
                        the command --room-create.
  --topic TOPIC [TOPIC ...]
                        Specify one or multiple topics. This option is only
                        meaningful in combination with option --room-create.
                        This option --topic specifies the topics to be used
                        with the command --room-create.
  -m MESSAGE [MESSAGE ...], --message MESSAGE [MESSAGE ...]
                        Send this message. Message data must not be binary
                        data, it must be text. If no '-m' is used and no other
                        conflicting arguments are provided, and information is
                        piped into the program, then the piped data will be
                        used as message. Finally, if there are no operations
                        at all in the arguments, then a message will be read
                        from stdin, i.e. from the keyboard. This option can be
                        used multiple times to send multiple messages. If
                        there is data piped into this program, then first data
                        from the pipe is published, then messages from this
                        option are published. Messages will be sent last, i.e.
                        after objects like images, audio, files, events, etc.
                        Input piped via stdin can additionally be specified
                        with the special character '-'. If you want to feed a
                        text message into matrix-commander via a pipe, via
                        stdin, then specify the special character '-'. If '-'
                        is specified as message, then the program will read
                        the message from stdin. If your message is literally
                        '-' then use '\-' as message in the argument. '-' may
                        appear in any position, i.e. '-m "start" - "end"' will
                        send 3 messages out of which the second one is read
                        from stdin. '-' may appear only once overall in all
                        arguments.
  -i IMAGE [IMAGE ...], --image IMAGE [IMAGE ...]
                        Send this image. This option can be used multiple
                        times to send multiple images. First images are sent,
                        then text messages are sent. If you want to feed an
                        image into matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin,
                        then specify the special character '-'. If '-' is
                        specified as image file name, then the program will
                        read the image data from stdin. If your image file is
                        literally named '-' then use '\-' as file name in the
                        argument. '-' may appear in any position, i.e. '-i
                        image1.jpg - image3.png' will send 3 images out of
                        which the second one is read from stdin. '-' may
                        appear only once overall in all arguments. If the file
                        exists already, it is more efficient to specify the
                        file name than to pipe the file through stdin.
  -a AUDIO [AUDIO ...], --audio AUDIO [AUDIO ...]
                        Send this audio file. This option can be used multiple
                        times to send multiple audio files. First audios are
                        sent, then text messages are sent. If you want to feed
                        an audio into matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin,
                        then specify the special character '-'. See
                        description of '-i' to see how '-' is handled.
  -f FILE [FILE ...], --file FILE [FILE ...]
                        Send this file (e.g. PDF, DOC, MP4). This option can
                        be used multiple times to send multiple files. First
                        files are sent, then text messages are sent. If you
                        want to feed a file into matrix-commander via a pipe,
                        via stdin, then specify the special character '-'. See
                        description of '-i' to see how '-' is handled.
  -e EVENT [EVENT ...], --event EVENT [EVENT ...]
                        Send an event that is formatted as a JSON object as
                        specified by the Matrix protocol. This allows the
                        advanced user to send additional types of events such
                        as reactions, send replies to previous events, or edit
                        previous messages. Specifications for events can be
                        found at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/.
                        This option can be used multiple times to send
                        multiple events. First events are sent, then text
                        messages are sent. If you want to feed an event into
                        matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify
                        the special character '-'. See description of '-i' to
                        see how '-' is handled. See tests/test-event.sh for
                        examples.
  -w, --html            Send message as format "HTML". If not specified,
                        message will be sent as format "TEXT". E.g. that
                        allows some text to be bold, etc. Only a subset of
                        HTML tags are accepted by Matrix.
  -z, --markdown        Send message as format "MARKDOWN". If not specified,
                        message will be sent as format "TEXT". E.g. that
                        allows sending of text formatted in MarkDown language.
  -k, --code            Send message as format "CODE". If not specified,
                        message will be sent as format "TEXT". If both --html
                        and --code are specified then --code takes priority.
                        This is useful for sending ASCII-art or tabbed output
                        like tables as a fixed-sized font will be used for
                        display.
  -p SPLIT, --split SPLIT
                        If set, split the message(s) into multiple messages
                        wherever the string specified with --split occurs.
                        E.g. One pipes a stream of RSS articles into the
                        program and the articles are separated by three
                        newlines. Then with --split set to "\n\n\n" each
                        article will be printed in a separate message. By
                        default, i.e. if not set, no messages will be split.
  --config CONFIG       Location of a config file. By default, no config file
                        is used. If this option is provided, the provided file
                        name will be used to read configuration from. Not
                        implemented.
  --proxy PROXY         Optionally specify a proxy for connectivity. By
                        default, i.e. if this option is not set, no proxy is
                        used. If this option is used a proxy URL must be
                        provided. The provided proxy URL will be used for the
                        HTTP connection to the server. The proxy supports
                        SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5, and HTTP (tunneling). Examples of
                        valid URLs are "http://10.10.10.10:8118" or
                        "socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080". URLs with
                        "https" or "socks4a" are not valid. Only "http",
                        "socks4" and "socks5" are valid.
  -n, --notice          Send message as notice. If not specified, message will
                        be sent as text.
  --encrypted           Send message end-to-end encrypted. Encryption is
                        always turned on and will always be used where
                        possible. It cannot be turned off. This flag does
                        nothing as encryption is turned on with or without
                        this argument.
  -s STORE, --store STORE
                        Path to directory to be used as "store" for encrypted
                        messaging. By default, this directory is "./store/".
                        Since encryption is always enabled, a store is always
                        needed. If this option is provided, the provided
                        directory name will be used as persistent storage
                        directory instead of the default one. Preferably, for
                        multiple executions of this program use the same store
                        for the same device. The store directory can be shared
                        between multiple different devices and users.
  -l [LISTEN], --listen [LISTEN]
                        The --listen option takes one argument. There are
                        several choices: "never", "once", "forever", "tail",
                        and "all". By default, --listen is set to "never". So,
                        by default no listening will be done. Set it to
                        "forever" to listen for and print incoming messages to
                        stdout. "--listen forever" will listen to all messages
                        on all rooms forever. To stop listening "forever", use
                        Control-C on the keyboard or send a signal to the
                        process or service. The PID for signaling can be found
                        in a PID file in directory "/home/user/.run". "--
                        listen once" will get all the messages from all rooms
                        that are currently queued up. So, with "once" the
                        program will start, print waiting messages (if any)
                        and then stop. The timeout for "once" is set to 10
                        seconds. So, be patient, it might take up to that
                        amount of time. "tail" reads and prints the last N
                        messages from the specified rooms, then quits. The
                        number N can be set with the --tail option. With
                        "tail" some messages read might be old, i.e. already
                        read before, some might be new, i.e. never read
                        before. It prints the messages and then the program
                        stops. Messages are sorted, last-first. Look at --tail
                        as that option is related to --listen tail. The option
                        "all" gets all messages available, old and new. Unlike
                        "once" and "forever" that listen in ALL rooms, "tail"
                        and "all" listen only to the room specified in the
                        credentials file or the --room options. Furthermore,
                        when listening to messages, no messages will be sent.
                        Hence, when listening, --message must not be used and
                        piped input will be ignored.
  -t [TAIL], --tail [TAIL]
                        The --tail option reads and prints up to the last N
                        messages from the specified rooms, then quits. It
                        takes one argument, an integer, which we call N here.
                        If there are fewer than N messages in a room, it reads
                        and prints up to N messages. It gets the last N
                        messages in reverse order. It print the newest message
                        first, and the oldest message last. If --listen-self
                        is not set it will print less than N messages in many
                        cases because N messages are obtained, but some of
                        them are discarded by default if they are from the
                        user itself. Look at --listen as this option is
                        related to --tail.Furthermore, when tailing messages,
                        no messages will be sent. Hence, when tailing or
                        listening, --message must not be used and piped input
                        will be ignored.
  -y, --listen-self     If set and listening, then program will listen to and
                        print also the messages sent by its own user. By
                        default messages from oneself are not printed.
  --print-event-id      If set and listening, then the program will print also
                        the event id for each message or other event.
  --download-media [DOWNLOAD_MEDIA]
                        If set and listening, then program will download
                        received media files (e.g. image, audio, video, text,
                        PDF files). media will be downloaded to local
                        directory. By default, media will be downloaded to is
                        "./media/". You can overwrite default with your
                        preferred directory. If media is encrypted it will be
                        decrypted and stored decrypted. By default media files
                        will not be downloaded.
  -o, --os-notify       If set and listening, then program will attempt to
                        visually notify of arriving messages through the
                        operating system. By default there is no notification
                        via OS.
  -v [VERIFY], --verify [VERIFY]
                        Perform verification. By default, no verification is
                        performed. Possible values are: "emoji". If
                        verification is desired, run this program in the
                        foreground (not as a service) and without a pipe.
                        Verification questions will be printed on stdout and
                        the user has to respond via the keyboard to accept or
                        reject verification. Once verification is complete,
                        stop the program and run it as a service again. Don't
                        send messages or files when you verify.
  --set-device-name SET_DEVICE_NAME
                        Set or rename the current device to the device name
                        provided. Send, listen and verify operations are
                        allowed when renaming the device.
  --set-display-name SET_DISPLAY_NAME
                        Set or rename the display name for the current user to
                        the display name provided. Send, listen and verify
                        operations are allowed when setting the display name.
  --get-display-name    Get the display name of matrix-commander (itself), or
                        of one or multiple users. Specify user(s) with the
                        --user option. If no user is specified get the display
                        name of itself. Send, listen and verify operations are
                        allowed when getting display name(s).
  --set-presence SET_PRESENCE
                        Set presence of {PROG_WITHOUT_EXT} to the given value.
                        Must be one of these values: “online”, “offline”,
                        “unavailable”. Otherwise an error will be produced.
  --get-presence        Get presence of {PROG_WITHOUT_EXT} (itself), or of one
                        or multiple users. Specify user(s) with the --user
                        option. If no user is specified get the presence of
                        itself. Send, listen and verify operations are allowed
                        when getting presence(s).
  --upload UPLOAD [UPLOAD ...]
                        Upload one or multiple files to the content
                        repository. The files will be given a Matrix URI and
                        stored on the server. --upload allows the optional
                        argument --plain to skip encryption for upload. See
                        tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --download DOWNLOAD [DOWNLOAD ...]
                        Download one or multiple files from the content
                        repository. You must provide one or multiple Matrix
                        URIs (MXCs) which are strings like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'. If found they
                        will be downloaded, decrypted, and stored in local
                        files. If file names are specified with --file-name
                        the downloads will be saved with these file names. If
                        --file-name is not specified the original file name
                        from the upload will be used. If neither specified nor
                        available on server, then the file name of last resort
                        'mxc-<mxc-id>' will be used. If a file name in --file-
                        name contains the placeholder __mxc_id__, it will be
                        replaced with the mxc-id. If a file name is specified
                        as empty string in --file-name, then also the name
                        'mxc-<mxc-id>' will be used. By default, the upload
                        was encrypted so a decryption dictionary must be
                        provided to decrypt the data. Specify one or multiple
                        decryption keys with --key-dict. If --key-dict is not
                        set, not decryption is attempted; and the data might
                        be stored in encrypted fashion, or might be plain-text
                        if the --upload skipped encryption with --plain. See
                        tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --delete-mxc DELETE_MXC [DELETE_MXC ...]
                        Delete one or multiple objects (e.g. files) from the
                        content repository. You must provide one or multiple
                        Matrix URIs (MXC) which are strings like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'. Alternatively,
                        you can just provide the MXC id, i.e. the part after
                        the last slash. If found they will be deleted from the
                        server database. In order to delete objects one must
                        have server admin permissions. Having only room admin
                        permissions is not sufficient and it will fail. Read
                        https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/admi
                        nistration/admin_api/ for learning how to set server
                        admin permissions on the server. Alternatively, and
                        optionally, one can specify an access token which has
                        server admin permissions with the --access-token
                        argument. See tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --delete-mxc-before DELETE_MXC_BEFORE [DELETE_MXC_BEFORE ...]
                        Delete objects (e.g. files) from the content
                        repository that are older than a given timestamp. It
                        is the timestamp of last access, not the timestamp
                        when the file was created. Additionally you can
                        specify a size in bytes to indicate that only files
                        older than timestamp and larger than size will be
                        deleted. You must provide a timestamp of the following
                        format: 'DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS' like '20.01.2022
                        19:38:42' for January 20, 2022, 7pm 38min 42sec. Files
                        that are still used in image data (e.g user profile,
                        room avatar) will not be deleted from the server
                        database. In order to delete objects one must have
                        server admin permissions. Having only room admin
                        permissions is not sufficient and it will fail. Read
                        https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/admi

                        admin permissions on the server. Alternatively, and
                        optionally, one can specify an access token which has
                        server admin permissions with the --access-token
                        argument. See tests/test-upload.sh for an example.
  --joined-rooms        Print the list of joined rooms. All rooms that you are
                        a member of will be printed, one room per line.
  --joined-members JOINED_MEMBERS [JOINED_MEMBERS ...]
                        Print the list of joined members for one or multiple
                        rooms. If you want to print the joined members of all
                        rooms that you are member of, then use the special
                        character '*'.
  --mxc-to-http MXC_TO_HTTP [MXC_TO_HTTP ...]
                        Convert one or more matrix content URIs to the
                        corresponding HTTP URLs. The MXC URIs to provide look
                        something like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'. See tests/test-
                        upload.sh for an example.
  --devices             Print the list of devices. All device of this account
                        will be printed, one device per line.
  --discovery-info      Print discovery information about current homeserver.
                        Note that not all homeservers support discovery and an
                        error might be reported.
  --login-info          Print login methods supported by the homeserver. It
                        prints one login method per line.
  --rest REST [REST ...]
                        Use the Matrix Client REST API. Matrix has several
                        extensive REST APIs. With the --rest argument you can
                        invoke a Matrix REST API call. This allows the user to
                        do pretty much anything, at the price of not being
                        very convenient. The APIs are described in
                        https://matrix.org/docs/api/,
                        https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/,
                        https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/admi
                        nistration/admin_api/, etc. Each REST call requires
                        exactly 3 arguments. So, the total number of arguments
                        used with --rest must be a multiple of 3. The argument
                        triples are: (a) the method, a string of GET, POST,
                        PUT, DELETE, or OPTIONS. (b) a string containing the
                        data (if any) in JSON format. (c) a string containing
                        the URL. All strings must be UTF-8. There are a few
                        placeholders. They are: __homeserver__ (like
                        https://matrix.example.org), __hostname__ (like
                        matrix.example.org), __access_token__, __user_id__
                        (like @mc:matrix.example.com), __device_id__, and
                        __room_id__. If a placeholder is found it is replaced
                        with the value from the local credentials file. An
                        example would be: --rest 'GET' ''
                        '__homeserver__/_matrix/client/versions'. If there is
                        no data, i.e. data (b) is empty, then use '' for it.
                        Optionally, --access-token can be used to overwrite
                        the access token from credentials (if needed). See
                        tests/test-rest.sh for an example.
  --set-avatar SET_AVATAR
                        Set the avatar MXC resource used by matrix-commander.
                        Provide one MXC URI that looks like this
                        'mxc://example.com/SomeStrangeUriKey'..
  --get-avatar [GET_AVATAR ...]
                        Get the avatar MXC resource used by matrix-commander,
                        or one or multiple other users. Specify zero or more
                        user ids. If no user id is specified, the avatar of
                        {PROG_WITHOUT_EXT} will be fetched. If one or more
                        user ids are given, the avatars of these users will be
                        fetched. As response both MXC URI as well as URL will
                        be printed.
  --whoami              Print the user id used by matrix-commander (itself).
                        One can get this information also by looking at the
                        credentials file.
  --no-ssl              Skip SSL verification. By default (if this option is
                        not used) the SSL certificate is validated for the
                        connection. But, if this option is used, then the SSL
                        certificate validation will be skipped. This is useful
                        for home-servers that have no SSL certificate. If used
                        together with the "--ssl-certificate" parameter, this
                        option is meaningless and an error will be raised.
  --ssl-certificate SSL_CERTIFICATE
                        Use this option to use your own local SSL certificate
                        file. This is an optional parameter. This is useful
                        for home servers that have their own SSL certificate.
                        This allows you to use HTTPS/TLS for the connection
                        while using your own local SSL certificate. Specify
                        the path and file to your SSL certificate. If used
                        together with the "--no-ssl" parameter, this option is
                        meaningless and an error will be raised.
  --no-sso              This argument is optional. If it is not used, the
                        default login method will be used. This default login
                        method is: SSO (Single Sign-On). SSO starts a web
                        browser and connects the user to a web page on the
                        server for login. SSO will only work if the server
                        supports it and if there is access to a browser. If
                        this argument is used, then SSO will be avoided. This
                        is useful on headless homeservers where there is no
                        browser installed or accessible. It is also useful if
                        the user prefers to login via a password. So, if SSO
                        should be avoided and a password login is preferred
                        then set this option. This option is only meaningful
                        on the first run that initializes matrix-commander.
                        Once credentials are established this option is
                        irrelevant and it will simply be ignored.
  --file-name FILE_NAME [FILE_NAME ...]
                        Specify one or multiple file names for some actions.
                        This is an optional argument. Use this option in
                        combination with options like --download to specify
                        one or multiple file names. Ignored if used by itself
                        without an appropriate corresponding action.
  --key-dict KEY_DICT [KEY_DICT ...]
                        Specify one or multiple key dictionaries for
                        decryption. One or multiple decryption dictionaries
                        are provided by the --upload action as a result. A
                        decryption dictionary is a string like this: "{'v':
                        'v2', 'key': {'kty': 'oct', 'alg': 'A256CTR', 'ext':
                        True, 'k': 'somekey', 'key_ops': ['encrypt',
                        'decrypt']}, 'iv': 'someiv', 'hashes': {'sha256':
                        'someSHA'}}". If you have a list of key dictionaries
                        and want to skip one, use the empty string.
  --plain               Disable encryption for a specific action. By default,
                        everything is always encrypted. Actions that support
                        this option are: --upload.
  --separator SEPARATOR
                        Set a custom separator used for certain print outs. By
                        default, i.e. if --separator is not used, 4 spaces are
                        used as separator between columns in print statements.
                        You could set it to '\t' if you prefer a tab, but tabs
                        are usually replaced with spaces by the terminal. So,
                        that might not give you what you want. Maybe ' || ' is
                        an alternative choice.
  --access-token ACCESS_TOKEN
                        Set a custom access token for use by certain actions.
                        It is an optional argument. By default --access-token
                        is ignored and not used. It is used only by the
                        --delete-mxc, --delete-mxc-before and --rest actions.
  --version             Print version information. After printing version
                        information program will continue to run. This is
                        useful for having version number in the log files.

# Autocompletion

Tab completion is provided for shells (e.g. bash), courtesy of @mizlan).

Here is a sample snapshot of tab completion in action:

![tab completion screenshot](screenshots/tab_complete.png)

# Performance and Speed

- `matrix-commander` is written in Python and hence rather on the slow side
- It is not thread-safe. One cannot just simply run multiple instances
  at the same time. However, with very careful set-up one can run
  multiple instances, but that is not the target use case.
- Where possible bundle several actions together into a single call.
  For example if one wants to send 8 images, then it is significantly faster
  to call `matrix-commander` once with `-i` specifying 8 images, than
  to call `matrix-commander` 8 times with one image each call. One needs
  to send 5 messages, 10 images, 5 audios, 3 PDF files and 7 events to
  the same user? Call `matrix-commander` once, not 30 times.

# For Developers

- Don't change tabbing, spacing, or formatting as file is automatically
  sorted, linted and formatted.
- `pylama:format=pep8:linters=pep8`
- first `isort` import sorter
- then `flake8` linter/formater
- then `black` linter/formater
- line length: 79
  - isort matrix_commander.py
  - flake8 matrix_commander.py
  - python3 -m black --line-length 79 matrix_commander.py
- There is a script called `lintmc.sh` in `scripts` directory for that.

When preparing to package `matrix-commander` for NIX the question
came up if `matrix-commander` is GPL3Only or GPL3Plus. GPL3PLus was
deemed to be better. As such the license was changed from GPL3Only
to GPL3Plus on May 25, 2021. Versions before this date are licensed
under GPL3. Versions on or after this date are GPL3Plus, i.e.
GPL3 or later.

) -> list:
    """Determine the rooms to send to.

    Users can be specified with --user for send and listen operations.
    These rooms we label DM (direct messaging) rooms.
    By that we means rooms that only have 2 members, and these two
    members being the sender and the recipient in question.
    We do not care about 'is_group' or 'is_direct' flags (hints).

    If given a user and known the sender, we try to find a matching room.
    There might be 0, 1, or more matching rooms. If 0, then giver error
    and the user should run --room-invite first. if 1 found, use it.
    If more than 1 found, just use 1 of them arbitrarily.

    The steps are:
    - get all rooms where sender is member
    - get all members to these rooms
    - check if there is a room with just 2 members and them
      being sender and recipient (user from users arg)

    In order to match a user to a RoomMember we allow 3 choices:
    - user_id: perfect match, is unique, full user id, e.g. "@user:example.org"
    - user_id without homeserver domain: partial user id, e.g. "@user"
      this partial user will be completed by adding the homeserver of the
      sender to the end, i.e. assuming that sender and receiver are on the
      same homeserver.
    - display name: be careful, display names are NOT unique, you could be
      mistaken and by error send to the wrong person.
      '--joined-members "*"' shows you the display names in the middle column

    Arguments:
    ---------
        users: list(str): list of user_ids
            try to find a matching DM room for each user
        client: AsyncClient: client, allows as to query the server
        credentials: dict: allows to get the user_id of sender

    Alternative implementation of listen_once().
    We don't use any callbacks and we just call sync() and get all
    of the MessageEvents from the timeline of the reply provided by
    sync(). This is more work than listen_once() but it is interesting
    case study to understand sync().

    sync() response includes the member `rooms` (of class nio.responses.Rooms).
    Rooms have 3 top dicts.
    Rooms(invite={}, join={...}, leave={})
    join has a dict entry of type RoomInfo for
    each room. And the RoomInfo has a timeline (of class TimeLine) with
    all currently queued up events. So, timeline has a list of events
    such as RoomMessageText, RoomMessageNotice, etc. One can go through
    these timeline event lists and process each queued up message.

    This is an example Rooms object that is part of a sync() response.
    This example gives the details on 2 currently queued up messages.
